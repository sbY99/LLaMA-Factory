Posterior decompression of the cervical spine, C3-4-5  \\n2. Posterior instrumentation with fusion using bone graft (iliac bone and local bone), C3-4-5  \\n**Operative Findings:**  \\n1. Severe narrowing of the cervical spinal canal was observed, with the dural sac compressed.  \\n2. After decompression, the spinal cord was released at the C2-3-4-5 levels, and dural pulsation was confirmed.  \\n3. The bilateral foramina at the C3-4-5 levels were found to be free compared to the central canal.  \\n4. No intraoperative findings of dural tear were noted.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the prone position. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. A C-arm was utilized to confirm the C4-5 level, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision above and below this level. The fascia was divided, and the paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C3-4-5-6 facet joints. The spinous processes of the C3, C4, and C5 vertebrae were removed. During decompression, care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear, with a burr used to remove the laminae of the C3, C4, and C5 vertebrae. Additional decompression was performed using punches around the spinal cord. Local bone harvested during decompression was prepared as chip bone. Cancellous and cortical bone was harvested from the right iliac crest for bone grafting and prepared as chip bone. Three K-wires were inserted into the left lateral masses of the C3, C4, and C5 vertebrae, and the lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed using a C-arm. Based on this, three lateral mass screws were inserted. The lateral mass was decorticated using a burr to prepare the site for bone grafting. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed on the left lateral mass screws. The previously prepared chip bone and Bongross HA were mixed and placed into the decorticated site for bone grafting. The same sequence was repeated for the right side of C3-4-5. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac drains. Thrombin was applied to ensure effective hemostasis. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and dressed with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punch techniques. Ten K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which were then used for screw placement. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed. The left iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. The cortical bone of the lateral masses at C3 through C7 was decorticated using a burr, and the graft was prepared by mixing local bone with iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac drains were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, followed by occlusive dressing, and the surgery was concluded.\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Dissection was carried out to fully expose the C3-C6 bilateral laminae. The left side laminae of C3-C6 were removed using a high-speed drill to create a gutter, while the right side was prepared as a hinge by leaving some cortical bone to induce a green stick fracture. Subsequently, a Medtronic brand plate (10mm x 1 piece for C3, 12mm x 3 pieces for C4-C6) was fixed with screws to perform laminoplasty. The spinal cord was confirmed to be fully decompressed, with no signs of spinal cord compression.  \\n4. Hemostasis and irrigation were performed. A H-vac suction device was inserted, and the wound was closed in layers before concluding the procedure.  \\nTransient electromyography (EMG) was noted intraoperatively but resolved promptly. Evoked potential (EP) showed no significant deviation from baseline values.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: [DATE] 1:07 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C3-4-5 facet joints. The spinous processes of C3, 4, and 5 were removed. Decompression was performed around the spinal cord, with care taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear, using a burr to remove the laminae of C3, 4, and 5. Additional decompression was carried out around the spinal cord using punches. Decompression was performed on the neural foramina of C5-6 and C6-7 using a burr. A keyhole foraminotomy was performed. Six K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3-C5. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which were then referenced for screw placement. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. The cortical bone of the lateral masses at C3-4-5 was decorticated using a burr. Iliac bone and local bone were mixed and used as a graft. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. A guadix 6g was applied, and two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. The wound was closed layer by layer, followed by an occlusive dressing and application of a Philadelphia brace. The surgery was concluded.  \\n\\n**Author**: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time**: [DATE] 20:21\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A midline longitudinal skin incision was made over C3-5, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached to confirm the level using intraoperative X-ray.  \\nSubperiosteal dissection was performed from the lamina posterior and facet joint to the transverse process at C3-4-5. K-wires were inserted into the pedicles of C3-4-5, and intraoperative X-ray confirmed the entry points and convergence angles of the pedicle screws. All pedicle screws (PRIMA OCT screws, 3.5*12, 3 pieces; 3.5*14, 3 pieces) were inserted, followed by the fitting and insertion of a rod (40/50). Instrumentation was performed with distraction. Autologous bone was harvested from the right iliac crest and prepared as chip bone.  \\nPosterior fusion was performed using autologous and allograft bone after decompression of the posterior cortex at C3-4-5. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Guardix (bone graft material) was applied around the dura, and two H-vacuum devices were inserted. The wound was closed layer by layer.  \\nThe patient was then positioned supine with the neck in extension, and standard draping was performed. The thyroid and cricoid cartilages were palpated to estimate the C4-6 level. A 3 cm transverse skin incision was made over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. The platysma muscle was incised along the fiber direction, and the superficial cervical fascia was dissected. Deep dissection was performed along the fascial plane. The vertebral body was palpated, and a needle was inserted into the disc space with portable X-ray to confirm the C6 level.  \\nUsing a self-retractor for distraction, discectomy was performed at C4-5 and C5-6 under microscopic visualization with punch and pituitary forceps. The remaining disc fragments were thoroughly removed using curettage, and curettage was performed on the superior and inferior vertebrae. Stability was confirmed after distraction. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Guardix (bone graft material) was applied around the dura, and two H-vacuum devices were inserted. The wound was closed layer by layer, and a Philadelphia neck brace was applied to complete the surgery.  \\nDocumented by: R1.

After removal of the disc to achieve decompression, the spinal cord was released, and dural pulsation was confirmed.  \\n2. Bone density was poor, but no neurovascular injury was observed during surgery.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nThe patient was placed in the supine position with the neck extended. Standard skin preparation and draping were performed. The thyroid cartilage and cricoid cartilage were palpated to estimate the C5-7 level. The left sternocleidomastoid muscle was palpated, and a transverse skin incision of approximately 3\\u20134 cm was made. The platysma muscle was vertically incised along its fiber direction, and the superficial cervical fascia was dissected. The fascial plane was deepened for dissection. The vertebral body was palpated for confirmation. A curved K-wire was inserted into the C5, 6, and 7 vertebral bodies. Using a C-arm, the C5 level was confirmed. With the Casper distractor maintaining distraction, microscopic visualization was achieved. Punch and pituitary forceps were used to sequentially perform discectomy on the C5-6 and C6-7 intervertebral discs. Curettage was used to thoroughly remove residual disc material, and curettage was also performed on the superior and inferior vertebral bodies. Allograft and autograft bone chips were prepared and placed into three cages, which were then inserted into the C5-6 and C6-7 disc spaces. After releasing distraction, the stability of each vertebral body was confirmed. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two H-vacs were inserted, and wound closure was performed layer by layer. A Philadelphia neck brace was applied to complete the surgery.  \\n**Documented by:** [NAME]  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date Written:** [DATE] at 03:20 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

After decompression, the spinal cord was released, and dural pulsation was confirmed.  \\n#2. No findings of dural tear or other abnormalities were noted intraoperatively.  \\nOperative Procedure:  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the prone position. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the C-spine. Using a C-arm, the C2-3-4 level was confirmed. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made above and below, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina posteriorly and the facet joints to the C2-3-4 facet joints. After removing the spinous process of C3, decompression was performed with caution for spinal cord compression and dural tear using a burr to remove the lamina of C3 and C4. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using a punch. Six Kirschner wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C2, C3, and C4. The C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, and the screws were then inserted accordingly. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. Subsequently, the right iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. The cortical bone of the lateral masses of C2-3-4 was decorticated using a burr, and the local bone and iliac bone were mixed and used as a graft. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two hemostatic vacuum lines. A single Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted at the iliac bone harvest site. The layers were closed sequentially, and an occlusive dressing was applied to complete the surgery.  \\nDescribed by R1: [NAME]  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: [DATE] 12:41 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Posterior fusion of the cervical spine, C3-4-5-6-7  \\nOperative Procedure:  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was positioned prone. Standard techniques were employed for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. The C3-C7 levels were marked using a C-arm. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina posteriorly and the facet joints. All facet joints were exposed, and the spinous processes were removed using a bone cutter.  \\nA separate incision was made on the left iliac crest, and the iliac bone was harvested. Efforts were made to obtain the maximum amount of cancellous bone, which was separately preserved.  \\nUsing a Rounger and punch, the C3-C7 spinous processes and posterior ligamentous complex (PLC) were removed. Lateral mass screws were inserted, and a rod was contoured to match the normal lordosis and inserted. The screws were fixed to complete the instrumentation. The harvested iliac cancellous bone was placed as a base and shaped for local bone insertion. After irrigation, an H-vac line was placed, and a Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted at the iliac bone graft site. The wound was closed in layers and sutured.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]  \\nDate and Time: DATE at 00:25\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Ossification of the Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (OPLL), C5  \\n- **Procedure:**  \\n  1. Anterior approach was performed, revealing severe disc degeneration with protrusion at the C6/7 level. The discs compressing the spinal cord were completely removed.  \\n  2. OPLL was observed at C5, and the areas compressing the spinal cord were entirely excised.  \\n- **Operative Technique:**  \\n  The patient was positioned supine under general anesthesia. Aseptic technique was applied to the anterior neck area, with a transverse incision made after identifying the appropriate vertebral level via palpation of the thyroid cartilage and clavicle. The platysma was dissected, and the longus colli and carotid artery were retracted laterally, while the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially to expose the C5/6 and 6/7 vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc spaces. Using pituitary forceps and a curette, the disc material compressing the spinal cord was thoroughly removed to achieve decompression. The spinal cord was severely compressed, but pulsation resumed after decompression. A bone graft was harvested from the right anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), and allograft bone (fibula, 7.5mm, 7mm) was packed into the C5/6 and 6/7 disc spaces. Remaining areas were filled with local bone graft, and meticulous hemostasis was performed. An Atlantis plate was used to perform two-level anterior fusion. After massive irrigation, the layers were sutured layer by layer, and two lines of hemovac drains were inserted to complete the surgical procedure.  \\n**Described by R3 [NAME]**  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date Written:** [DATE] 2:45 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. A C-arm was utilized to confirm the level of C3 through C7, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision and fascia division. Paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the facet joints of C3 through C7. The spinous processes of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed, with careful attention to cord compression and dural tear. Additional decompression was performed around the cord using punch techniques. Two K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7. The lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed using a C-arm. Lateral mass screws were then inserted accordingly. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. A right iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. Cortical bone from the lateral masses of C3 through C7 was decorticated using a burr, and the local bone was mixed with the iliac bone for grafting. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.  \\n\\nThrombin 1 ea  \\nGuardix (hemostatic agent) 3 g 1 ea  \\nGelfoam 2 ea  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: DATE\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3-4-5-6-7 levels were confirmed. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made above and below the levels, and the fascia was divided. Paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the laminae and facet joints of C3-4-5-6-7. The spinous processes of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear, and the laminae of C3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were removed using a burr. Additional decompression was performed around the cord using punches. Ten K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3 and C7. Using a C-arm, the lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed. Lateral mass screws were then inserted based on these findings. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed. Right iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. The cortical bone of the lateral masses of C3-4-5-6-7 was decorticated using a burr. The graft was prepared by mixing local bone and iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. A JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and occlusive dressing was applied to complete the surgery.  \\n\\n**<Equipment & Materials>**  \\nPRIMA OCT screws (3.5 *12mm/ 3.5*14mm 3/7), rod 80 2, nut 10  \\n**<BioAlpha>**  \\nBongros-HA 10CC, Thrombin 1@ * 2, Spongostan * 5  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Creation Time:** [DATE] 4:51 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia in the prone position without head fixation, Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was applied.  \\n2. After confirming the spinal level using a C-arm, a midline skin incision was made, and muscle splitting was performed to expose the C2-3 lamina and spinous process. The C2-3 interlaminar space was identified, and soft tissue was cleared using a rongeur. The C2 spinous process was noted to be bifid, with the gap filled with muscle and soft tissue. Using a pituitary and punch, muscle and soft tissue were meticulously cleared to expose the lower margin of the C2 spinous process and lamina. A burr and punch were used to perform a partial laminectomy of the C2 lamina. Post-laminectomy, thickened ligamentum flavum and soft tissue were exposed.  \\n3. Thickened soft tissue and ligamentum flavum were removed using a punch, performing a flavectomy. The ligamentum flavum was severely thickened with significant adhesion to the dura. Epidural fat was minimally observed. Adhesive areas were dissected using a dissector, and the ligamentum flavum was removed to achieve decompression of the dural sac.  \\n4. A partial laminectomy and flavectomy were performed on the upper margin of the C3 lamina using a punch, following the same method for decompression. Moderate bleeding occurred, and dural pulsation was confirmed post-decompression.  \\n5. Bleeding was controlled using a bipolar device, and additional hemostasis was performed with Floseal. A JP drain was inserted. Saline irrigation was performed, and the wound was closed in layers.  \\nSurgery concluded with transfer to the recovery room. No significant findings noted on IOM during the procedure.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: DATE 11:20 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in supine position with Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) applied. Baseline Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) and Sensory Evoked Potentials (SEP) were checked. A neck collar was applied, and the patient was positioned prone with slight neck flexion followed by skull fixation. MEP/SEP were rechecked to confirm no baseline changes, and the neck collar was removed. Partial shaving of the posterior neck area was performed, followed by betadine soaping, painting, and aseptic draping.  \\n2. A midline vertical skin incision was made from the inion to the prominent process. Subcutaneous tissue dissection was performed to expose the spinous process tip. A self-retaining retractor was applied, and paraspinal muscles were dissected periosteally to expose the C1 posterior arch and C2-7 laminae.  \\n3. A Misonix bone scalpel was used to cut the C1 posterior arch 1 cm on each side (total 2 cm), with no cord injury. A similar laminectomy was performed at C2, and the lateral aspect of the C1-2 spinal cord was confirmed to be adequately decompressed.  \\n4. At C3-7, a bone scalpel was used to create gutters 1 cm from the midline on both sides. The left side was opened, while the right side was prepared as a hinge. The lamina was folded toward the right side. Upon inspection, a dural tear was identified at the C3-4 level during gutter creation. This was sealed using Tachosil (hemostatic agent) and Durasel (dural sealant), with no further CSF leakage. A centerpiece OD plate (C3-6, 12mm, 4 pieces; C7, 14mm, 1 piece) and screws (5mm, 10 pieces) were fixed to the lamina opening site. No hinge fracture occurred during this process.  \\n5. Hemostasis was achieved using Surgicel, and saline irrigation confirmed no active bleeding. A H-vac (1 piece) was inserted, and layer-by-layer closure was performed. Due to CSF leakage concerns, a lumbar drain was placed.  \\nNo significant events occurred during surgery other than the noted findings, and IOM showed no changes.  \\nPostoperatively, the patient regained consciousness from anesthesia and was transferred to the PACU.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: [DATE] 19:45\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Autologous Iliac Bone Graft, Anterior Superior Iliac Spine (ASIS), Left Side  \\n- Postoperative Diagnosis: Same as above  \\n- Operative Findings: #1. Herniated discs at C3-4 and C4-5 were observed to compress the spinal cord. Adequate decompression was performed. #2. No definite injury to neurovascular structures, trachea, esophagus, or spinal cord dura occurred during the procedure.  \\n\\n**Surgical Technique and Procedure:**  \\n1. The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia, with the neck maintained in a neutral position. Standard skin preparation and draping were performed.  \\n2. After confirming the C3-C5 level with a C-arm guide, a transverse skin incision of approximately 4 cm was made on the anterior side of the neck.  \\n3. The platysma muscle was transversely incised and dissected, retracting the trachea and esophagus to the right and the left longus coli muscle to the left to expose the C3-4-5 vertebral bodies and discs.  \\n4. The vertebral bodies were palpated, and a K-wire was inserted into the vertebral body. A C-arm X-ray was performed to confirm the position.  \\n5. Osteophytes were removed, and portions of the superior and inferior vertebral bodies were partially removed using a burr to create an entry for disc removal.  \\n6. Casper screws were inserted into C3, C4, and C5. The spaces at C3-4 and C4-5 were expanded using casper instrumentation, followed by microscopic discectomy.  \\n7. A 1 cm incision was made on the lateral aspect of the left anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to harvest an adequate autologous iliac bone graft.  \\n8. At C3-4, an allogenic fibular ring graft (7 mm) filled with autologous iliac bone was inserted as a cage. At C4-5, an allogenic fibular ring graft (8 mm) filled with autologous iliac bone was inserted as a cage to achieve fusion.  \\n9. An anterior plate was fixed using C-arm guidance for C3-4-5.  \\n10. Massive irrigation and hemostasis were performed, followed by the application of a Hemovac drain.  \\n11. The wound was closed in layers, and a Philadelphia brace was applied.  \\n\\n**Instruments Used:**  \\n- Cervical Ring Spacer (L&C BIO): H1:8mm/H2:7mm/W:14mm/L:12mm  \\n- Cervical Ring Spacer (L&C BIO): H1:7mm/H2:6mm/W:15mm/L:12mm  \\n- SKYLINE Cervical Plate (L&H 2-level, 34mm)  \\n- SKYLINE Fixed Screws (L&H, 16mm, 2 pieces)  \\n- SKYLINE Variable Screws (L&H, 14mm, 4 pieces)  \\n- Spongostan (2 pieces)  \\n- Thrombin (2 pieces)  \\n- Collastat (3 ml, 1 piece)  \\n- Interblock (3 cc, 1 piece)  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 9:56 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Cervical Myelopathy  \\n**Operative Findings:**  \\n1. Anterior approach was performed, revealing calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and cord compression at the C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6 levels.  \\n2. All tissues compressing the cord were completely removed.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\n1. The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia. Aseptic technique was applied to drape the anterior neck area.  \\n2. The thyroid cartilage and clavicular margin were palpated to estimate the appropriate vertebral level, followed by a transverse incision and deepening of the layers.  \\n3. The platysma was dissected, with the longus colli and carotid artery retracted laterally, and the trachea/esophagus retracted medially.  \\n4. A saw and burr were used to create a longitudinal window in the C5 vertebral body, exposing the C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6 vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc spaces.  \\n5. Using pituitary forceps and a curette, disc material and ligaments compressing the cord were thoroughly removed to achieve decompression.  \\n6. The cord showed severe compression, but pulsation was restored after decompression.  \\n7. A bone graft was harvested from the right anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and inserted into the allograft fibula segment, completing the C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6 interbody fusion.  \\n8. Remaining areas were packed with local bone graft, and meticulous hemostasis was performed.  \\n9. A two-level anterior fusion was completed using an Atlantis plate. After massive irrigation, layers were sutured sequentially, and two hemovac drains were inserted, concluding the surgical procedure.  \\n**Implants Used:**  \\n- Atlantis Plate, Medtronic, 37.5 mm, 1 piece  \\n- Atlantis Screw, Medtronic Fixed, 15 mm, 4 pieces  \\n- Fibula Segment Allograft, CGBIO, 30 mm, 1 piece  \\n- Thrombin, 1 piece  \\n- Tissel, 2 ml, 2 pieces  \\n- Guardix, 6F, 1 piece  \\n- Surgicel, 5\\u00d735, 1 piece  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 9:56 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was applied. Skin antiseptics and aseptic draping were performed. A midline skin incision was made to expose the C2-C5 level after palpation and confirmation via C-arm imaging. Neck muscles were dissected midline to expose the C2-5 spinous process tips. Subperiosteal dissection using a Bovie device was performed to expose the C3-5 spinous process and lamina. The primary procedure involved using a Penfield #4 instrument to identify the V-point, followed by creating an open window using a cutting burr and diamond burr. A similar approach was performed on the right side to create a gutter at the V-point. The lamina on the left side was elevated, and the ligamentum flavum was removed. The ligament and ligamentum flavum at the C3-4 and C5-6 interspinous spaces were removed using a punch. Decompression of the thecal sac was confirmed, and a GS Medical open door laminoplasty plate was secured to the lamina. Closure included insertion of an H-Vac (2-lumen) device, followed by layer-by-layer suturing of the wound. Postoperatively, the patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room.  \\nInstruments Used: CAPAX plate, GS Medical open door plate (12mm, 3 pieces); 2.0 screw, GS Medical (5mm, 3 pieces); 2.4 screw, GS Medical (5mm, 3 pieces).  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: [DATE] at 2:46 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

No intraoperative findings of dural tear were observed.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was positioned prone. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. A C-arm was utilized to confirm the C3-4-5-6 level, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision and fascia division. Paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina and facet joints at C3-4-5-6-7-T1. The spinous processes at C3-4-5-6-7-T1 were removed, and care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the lamina. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches. K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, and C6, with C-arm confirmation of the lateral mass screw insertion sites. C7 and T1 received pedicle screw fixation, which was referenced for lateral mass screw placement. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. The cortical bone of the lateral masses at C3-4-5-6 was decorticated using a burr, and the local bone was mixed with iliac bone for grafting. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two hemostatic drains. A single Jackson-Pratt drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and dressed with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.  \\n**Thrombin:** 2 units  \\n**Spongostan:** 2 units  \\n**Guardix:** 1 unit  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date and Time of Entry:** [DATE] at 4:09 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A midline, vertical skin incision was made from C3 to C7 using a Carm device, with periosteal dissection to expose the spinous processes and laminae of C3-C7.  \\n  3. Interspinous ligaments were removed using a Rongeur and Kerrison rongeur. Partial spinous process removal was performed for C4-7. A C4 inferior laminectomy was conducted using a drill and Kerrison, with circumferential lamina removal to achieve mobilization. Adhesions between the dura and lamina were carefully dissected to remove remaining lamina. The dural sac exhibited posterior bulging during laminectomy.  \\n  4. Subsequently, a gutter was created on the right side sequentially from C5 to C6. The interlaminar space between C6-7 showed overlapping, creating a narrow corridor. A C6 lower partial laminectomy was performed to facilitate access to C7. A laminotomy was then executed on the left side sequentially from C5 to C6. The C5-6 laminae were exposed using a dissector and punch, with dura exposure. The dural sac again showed posterior bulging.  \\n  5. A C7 superior half laminectomy was performed using a drill and Kerrison. Decompression was confirmed through posterior dural sac bulging. An open door laminoplasty was performed using a center piece plate and screw to fix the C5-6 laminae.  \\n  6. Bleeding was meticulously controlled, and a single Hvac 1 implant was inserted. The wound was closed in layers. No intraoperative monitoring (IOM) abnormalities were noted, and no other intraoperative findings were observed. The patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU.  \\n**Instrumentation:**  \\n- CENTERPIECE PLATE 2 ea ([ORG])  \\n- CENTERPIECE SCREW 8 ea ([ORG])  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Authoring Time:** [DATE] 12:50 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

An anterior approach was performed, revealing severe disc degeneration with protrusion at the C6/7 level. The discs compressing the spinal cord were completely removed.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nThe patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia. Aseptic technique was applied to drape the anterior neck area. The thyroid cartilage and clavicular upper margin were palpated to estimate the appropriate vertebral level, followed by a transverse incision and deepening of the layers. The platysma was dissected, with the longus colli and carotid artery retracted laterally, and the trachea/esophagus retracted medially to expose the C6/7 vertebral body and intervertebral disc space. Using pituitary forceps and a currette, disc material compressing the spinal cord was thoroughly removed to achieve decompression. The spinal cord was severely compressed, but pulsation resumed after decompression. A cancerous bone graft was harvested from the left anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), with allograft (fibula, 7.5mm, 7mm) filling the internal space. This was then inserted into the C6/7 disc space. Local bone was used to pack the remaining area, with meticulous hemostasis performed. An Atlantis plate was utilized to achieve two-level anterior fusion. After extensive irrigation, the layers were sutured layer by layer, and two lines of Hemovac drains were inserted. The surgical procedure was then concluded.  \\n**Thrombin 1EA**  \\n**Guardix 3g 1EA**  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date:** [DATE] 02:28 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Decompression revealed release of the spinal cord at C4\\u2013C7, with dural pulsation confirmed. The bilateral foramina at C4\\u2013C7 were free relative to the central canal.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C4\\u2013C5 level was identified, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision and fascia division. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C4\\u2013C7 facet joints. The spinous processes of C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed, with care taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear. A burr was used to remove the laminae of these vertebrae. Additional decompression was performed using punches around the spinal cord, with local bone chips prepared. Cancellous and cortical bone grafts were harvested from the right iliac crest and prepared as chips. K-wires were inserted into the left lateral masses of C4\\u2013C7, and the lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed using a C-arm. Four lateral mass screws were inserted accordingly. The lateral masses were decorticated using a burr to prepare sites for bone grafting. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumented onto the four left lateral mass screws. The previously prepared local bone chips and iliac bone grafts were mixed and applied. The same sequence was repeated for the right side. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac drains and one JP drain at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and dressed occlusively to complete the procedure.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date and Time of Writing:** [DATE] [TIME]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard skin preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3-4-5-6 level was confirmed, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision. Fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C3-4-5-6 facet joints. The spinous processes at C3, 4, 5, and 6 were removed, with careful attention to cord compression and dural integrity. A burr was used to remove the laminae at C3-4-5-6. Additional decompression was performed around the cord using punches. Seven K-wires were inserted into the C3, C5, C6 bilateral lateral masses and C4 left lateral mass. C-arm imaging confirmed the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which were then used for screw placement. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed. Cortical bone was decorticated at the C3-4-5-6 lateral masses using a burr, followed by hemostasis and copious irrigation. Local bone grafting was performed, with additional DBM (5cc, 2.5cc x 2) applied to the fusion site. Due to severe right foraminal stenosis at C4-5, a keyhole foraminotomy was performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted, and the wound was closed in layers with an occlusive dressing.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] [TIME]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position with head fixation. Aseptic dressing and draping were performed.  \\n2. Using a C-arm fluoroscope, the C3-5 level was confirmed. A linear skin incision was made from C2 to C6, followed by paraspinal muscle dissection. After adequate exposure of the C3-5 lamina, a self-retaining retractor was applied.  \\n3. Bilateral C3-5 lateral mass screws were inserted at a 30-degree angle relative to the lateral mass. During this process, the right C4 lateral mass screw could not be secured and was removed.  \\n4. A portion of the C3-5 spinous process was removed using a bone cutter. Subsequently, a laminectomy was performed at C3-C5 using a punch. Notably, the spinal cord at the C3-4 level was severely compressed, and careful laminectomy was performed to achieve dural sac decompression. During the laminectomy, one episode of EMG occurred, which normalized within one minute.  \\n5. After bleeding control and extensive irrigation, a rod was inserted and secured between the left lateral mass screws. The fixation was confirmed to be stable. During the final rod insertion and fixation on the right side, the C5 lateral mass screw was found to be loose and was removed. Subsequently, new lateral mass screws were inserted at C3 and C5, followed by rod placement. During this process, one episode of EMG occurred, which normalized within one minute.  \\n6. Following extensive irrigation and bleeding control, two H-vac devices were inserted, and layered closure was performed.  \\n7. No changes were observed in the motor evoked potentials (MEP) or somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) before and after surgery. The patient was transferred to the recovery room postoperatively.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 6:36 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The muscles were dissected with periosteal dissection to expose the left C3 and C4 laminae. Dissection was performed laterally to expose the medial border of the facet joint. The level was reconfirmed using the C-arm. A hemi-lamina retractor was placed to include the left C3-4 lamina and facet joint.  \\n3. A drill and punch were used to remove the lower portion of the left C3 lamina and the upper portion of the left C4 lamina to perform the foraminotomy. The inferior facet was removed to expose the ligamentum flavum (LF), which showed significant adhesion. The LF was removed using a pituitary forcep and punch. Hemostasis was achieved using Surgicel and Floseal.  \\n4. The foraminotomy was performed at the left C4-5 level in a similar manner.  \\n5. Hemostasis was confirmed, and saline irrigation was performed to ensure no bleeding. The wound was closed layer by layer without a drain.  \\nAt the end of the surgery, the IOM showed increased activity in the left deltoid EMG, with baseline readings around 80 increasing to 180.  \\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery room after anesthesia was terminated.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nWriting Time: [DATE] 12:43 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

After confirming the level with a C-arm, a midline skin incision was made. The trapezius, splenius capitis, and semispinalis muscles were dissected to expose the spinous processes of C4-5-6-7.  \\n3. From the spinous process tips, periosteal dissection was performed along the laminae, dissecting the multifidus muscles and other soft tissues to expose the laminae of C4-5-6-7. The level was confirmed again with the C-arm.  \\n4. Drilling and punching were performed to open the left side of the laminae at C4-5-6, creating a gutter on the right side. The laminae were fractured in an open door fashion to laterally shift them, decompressing the spinal canal. For C7, the upper lamina was removed in a dome fashion to achieve decompression.  \\n5. An enterpiece OD plate (Medtronic, 12mm, 3 pieces) was applied to C4-5-6 and secured with screws. No instability was observed.  \\n6.

Patient positioned prone with head in neutral flexion, secured with a Mayfield fixator. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was installed, followed by aseptic draping.  \\n2. A midline, vertical skin incision was made from C4 to C7 using a Carm instrument. Periosteal dissection was performed to expose the C4 inferior half lamina, C5\\u20136 lamina, and C7 spinous process.  \\n3. Interspinous ligaments were removed using a rongeur and Kerrison rongeur. Partial removal of the C5\\u20136 spinous process was performed. A C4 inferior half laminectomy was conducted using a drill and Kerrison rongeur, with the dural sac observed to bulge posteriorly.  \\n4. A gutter was created on the left side sequentially from C5 to C6 using a drill. Subsequently, a laminotomy was performed on the right side using a drill and Kerrison rongeur. On the left gutter side, a hinge fracture occurred during the process of creating a green stick fracture of the C5 lamina using a dissector and punch. To address this, connective tissue and ligamentum flavum between the C5 lamina and dural sac were removed, allowing en bloc removal of the C5 lamina for laminectomy. The C6 lamina was opened on the right side using a dissector and punch to expose the dura. The lamina was fractured and displaced laterally, followed by fixation with a center piece plate and screw, completing an open door laminoplasty.  \\n5. Meticulous hemostasis was performed, and a single hemovac drain was inserted. The wound was closed in layers. No intraoperative monitoring (IOM) abnormalities were noted, and no other intraoperative findings were observed.

A midline, vertical skin incision was performed, and the muscular dissection and detachment were carried out to expose both laminae and the spinous process.  \\n3. Using a rongeur, the C3 spinous process and partial lamina were removed, followed by a punch for laminectomy. The epidural soft tissue was removed with caution, and transient EMG signals were observed during physical stimulation, indicating sensitivity. All EMG signals recovered promptly. The lateral margins of the dura were confirmed, and adequate decompression was achieved on the dorsal side of the C3 cord.  \\n4. High-speed drilling was performed on both sides of the C4-6 lamina to create a hinge site on the left and an open side on the right. The open side was thinned using a drill and then removed with a punch. The C4-6 right open side was carefully elevated to expose the dura\\u2019s dorsal side. A Medtronics center piece plate and screw were used to secure the elevated lamina, performing an open laminoplasty. Intraoperative monitoring showed no changes during laminoplasty. No hinge site fracture was observed. When the C4-6 lamina was elevated and secured, the previously compressed dural sac shifted posteriorly, restoring a normal bulging contour.  \\n5. The upper lamina of C7 was drilled and removed using a punch. Undercutting was performed to expose the dura\\u2019s dorsal side, removing bony structures and soft tissue.  \\n6. Irrigation was performed repeatedly with antibiotic saline. Hemorrhage control was achieved using Floseal. Two H-Vac drains were inserted. Layer-by-layer wound closure was performed, and the surgery was concluded.  \\nNo significant intraoperative monitoring changes were noted.  \\nPostoperative: The patient was transferred to the recovery room.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: [DATE] 5:25 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The patient was positioned in supine with a headrest and neck elevator to achieve neck extension. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was installed, followed by antiseptics and aseptic draping.  \\n2. Using a C-arm guide, the C3-4 level was confirmed. A paramedian transverse skin incision was made along the skin crease. Subcutaneous dissection exposed the platysma muscle, which was then dissected transversely to expose the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. Dissection between the SCM muscle\\u2019s medial border and the infrahyoid muscle revealed the carotid sheath, esophagus, and trachea. These structures were retracted laterally and medially to visualize the C4-5 vertebral bodies (VB) and intervertebral disc. The longus coli muscles were coagulated to create retractor space. CASPER screws were inserted into C3 and C4 VB, with levels confirmed using a C-arm.  \\n3. A CCR retractor was placed on the longus coli muscles and fixed. CASPER screws were distracted using a distractor to widen the intervertebral space. After a disc incision at C3-4, disectomy was performed using a punch and curette, followed by endplate preparation. Both Luschka\\u2019s joints were confirmed. Disc material was thoroughly removed using a punch and pituitary, and the endplate was exposed using a curette. The dural sac was partially exposed medially, with no dural tear.  \\n4. A cage filled with Osteogrow was inserted into the C3-4 disc space.

The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia. A Mayfield fixator was used for stabilization, followed by intraoperative electroencephalographic (EP) monitoring. Bethadine soaping, painting, and aseptic draping were performed.  \\n  2. Using a C-arm and palpation, C3 and C7 were localized. A midline skin incision was made to cover the C3\\u2013C7 level. The trapezius, splenius capitis, and semispinalis muscles were split, exposing the C3\\u2013C7 spinous processes.  \\n  3. The left lamina and lateral mass boundary was prepared with a 3mm cutting burr, leaving only the inner bony shell. The area was fully removed using a 3mm diamond burr, confirmed with a Penfield #4 dissector. The upper half of the C7 lamina was removed with a 6mm cutting burr, and the remaining bony shell and ligament were excised to expose the dural sac. The ligament between C6\\u2013C7 was also removed.  \\n  4. On the right side, the inner bony shell was preserved, and the spinous process was pushed to create mobility. The upper half of the C7 lamina was similarly removed. The midline bone was removed to ensure the left and right lamina removal sites met. A 6mm cutting burr was used to remove the spinous process below, and a Kerrison punch was used to eliminate bone obstructing the midline dural sac. Hemorrhage at the C7 lamina cut site margin was controlled with a hemostatic agent (tacocomb).  \\n  5. The spinous process was shifted from the patient\\u2019s left to right to create a greenstick fracture. The ligament between C2\\u2013C3 and C6\\u2013C7 was severed with a Kerrison punch to allow proper lamina flap expansion. Due to the thickness of the lamina, the right gutter above was burr-cut to create space. The C6 spinous process was bulky, so it was cut 1 cm below the tip, ensuring the lamina extended beyond while the spinous process tip remained near the midline.  \\n  6. A 12mm centerpiece plate (Medtronic, OD 12mm) was applied to C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6, and a 10mm plate (Medtronic, OD 10mm) to C3. Each lateral mass and lamina received a 5mm screw (Medtronic, 5mm*2.6mm) for fixation. Hemorrhage from the epidural vein at the lamina cut site was controlled with bipolar coagulation. The thecal sac was visualized and confirmed to be adequately decompressed. No hinge fracture was observed.  \\n  7. Two Hemovac drains were inserted, and the wound was closed in layers. No significant intraoperative IOM (intraoperative monitoring) changes were noted. The patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 5:49 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A three-point Mayfield fixator was attached to the skull. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was applied. Aseptic draping was performed.  \\n# Approach: After palpation of C2-C7 to confirm levels, a midline skin incision was performed to cover C2-7.

Paraspinal muscles were subperiosteally dissected to expose C3-7 lamina.  \\n# Main Procedure: Soft tissue in the C3-4 interlamina space was removed to identify the ligament flavum and define the C3 gutter boundary. The lamina and lateral mass boundaries were clearly visible from C4-6. A cutting burr was used to create gutters along the Rt side lamina and lateral mass boundaries in sequence from C3 to C6. A punch was used to remove the lamina and ligament flavum. The C7 upper lamina was then burr-shaped, and the thin bony shell and ligament were removed. The same technique was applied to the Lt side, creating gutters in C3-6 lamina for hinge function. The C7 upper lamina was burr-shaped, and the thin bony shell and ligament were removed. The lamina was then retracted to the Lt side to achieve decompression, exposing part of the dura. No dura tear or hinge fracture was observed across all levels.

Standard preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C7-T1 level was confirmed, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision. The fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to the lamina and facet joint. The spinous processes of C6, C7, and T1 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear, with a burr used to remove the laminae (total laminectomy for C6-7, partial laminectomy for T1). Additional decompression was performed around the cord using punches. Lateral mass screws were inserted on both sides of C6, left side of C7, and pedicle screws on the right side of C7 and both sides of T1. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. Local bone was prepared for grafting. Cortical bone from the lateral mass was decorticated using a burr, and the graft was prepared by mixing local bone with Demineralized Bone Matrix (DBM). Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac drains. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, and occlusive dressing was applied to complete the surgery.  \\nInstrumentation:  \\n3.5 mm Cervical Screws (U&I): 12 x 1, 14 x 2, 16 x 1  \\n4.0 mm Cervical Screws (U&I): 20 x 1, 24 x 1  \\nRod (U&I): 40 mm x 2  \\nNut (U&I): 6  \\nThrombin: 2 units  \\nSpongostan: 3 units  \\n[BRAND NAME] 1 cc each  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: [DATE] 1:50 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position with head fixation using a Mayfield frame. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was installed, followed by aseptic draping.  \\n2. A midline, vertical skin incision was performed to include the C3-C4 level. Muscle dissection and detachment were carried out to expose both laminae and the spinous process.  \\n3. A high-speed drill was used to create a C3 lamina hole, and the bony shell was removed using a Kerrison rongeur to perform a C3 laminectomy. Adhesions between the dura and ligamentum flavum (LF) were partially present and carefully removed. Subsequently, a planned C4 laminoplasty was initiated, with the left side designated as the hinge and the right side as the open side using a burr. However, significant adhesions between the C4 lamina and LF/dura were noted, and when the hinge side was opened, cord compression worsened, necessitating an unavoidable C4 laminectomy.  \\n4. Irrigation was performed, and a single closed drain was inserted. The wound was closed in layers, and the surgery was concluded.  \\n5. Preoperatively, the patient exhibited reduced thenar MEP in both upper limbs and decreased MEP in the right lower limb. Postoperatively, the upper limb remained unchanged, while the lower limb showed slight improvement. The patient was transferred to the PACU post-surgery.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: [DATE] 05:25\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm fluoroscope, the C4\\u2013C5 level was identified, and a midline longitudinal skin incision was made above and below this level. The fascia was divided, and the paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the laminae and facet joints of C3\\u2013C6. The spinous processes of C3, C4, C5, and C6 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae of C3, C4, C5, and C6. Additional decompression of the spinal cord was performed using punch instruments. Eight K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, and C6. A C-arm fluoroscope was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, and screws were then placed accordingly. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. A left iliac bone graft was harvested and prepared. The cortical bone of the lateral masses of C3\\u2013C6 was decorticated using a burr, and the graft was prepared by mixing local bone with iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-Vac drains were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The surgical site was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.  \\n**Documented by:** [NAME] M.D.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Document Date:** [DATE] 7:15 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

No intraoperative findings of dural tear were noted.  \\n- **Operative Procedure:**  \\n  The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia. Standard preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the levels of C3-4-5, C7-T1 were identified. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina posterior and facet joints at C3-4-5, C7-T1. The spinous processes at C3, C4, C5, and T1 were removed. With caution for cord compression and dural tear, the lamina at C3, C4, C5, and T1 was removed using a burr. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches. Nine K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, and T1 (bilateral). A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites. The lateral mass screws were then inserted based on these findings. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed. The left iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. The cortical bone of the lateral masses at C3-4-5, C7-T1 was decorticated using a burr. The graft was prepared by mixing local bone and iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac drains were inserted. The wound was closed in layers and occlusive dressing was applied to complete the surgery.  \\n\\n**Surgical Supplies:**  \\n- Tisseel 4ml x2  \\n- Thrombin x2  \\n- Spongostan x2  \\n- Cancellous Bone Chip 10cc  \\nWriter: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nWriting Time: [DATE] 9:47 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous processes.  \\nThe spinous processes were removed, and subperiosteal dissection was performed from the lamina posterior surface to the facet joints, exposing C3-C4-C5-C6-C7 facet joints. At C3, the lamina on both sides was fractured using a burr. The right side was opened, and two screws with a plate were used for fixation, performing an open door laminoplasty. A local bone graft was applied on the left side. The same procedure was performed for C4-C5-C6-C7.  \\nAfter copious irrigation, the paraspinal muscles were debrided. Two H-vac lines were inserted, and the wound was closed in a layer-by-layer fashion. An occlusive dressing was applied, and the surgery was concluded.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 3:41 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Periosteal dissection exposed the C2 spinous process, lower half lamina, C3/C4 spinous processes and lamina, lateral mass portion, C5 spinous process, and upper lamina portion. The level was rechecked with the Carm device.  \\n3. Using a Rongeur, the C3 and C4 spinous processes were removed. A drill was used to trim the C3 and C4 lamina into an eggshell-like shape. Subsequently, total laminectomy was performed in the order of C4 > C3 using Kerrison and Friedman Rongeur instruments. The spinal cord was posteriorly bulging, but pulsation showed minimal improvement. No IOM changes were observed.  \\n4. Bone structures were meticulously organized to ensure full exposure of the spinal cord's lateral margin. Irrigation was performed with massive anti-Bx mixed saline. An HVAC device (1 ea) was inserted into the OP bed, followed by layer-by-layer wound closure. No intraoperative complications or IOM changes were noted. The patient remained intubated and was transferred to the SICU.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: [DATE] 18:19\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The neck and craniovertebral junction were flexed, and Mayfield skull fixation was applied. The mandible was checked to ensure it did not contact the chest pad. Using a C-arm lateral view, the C3 level was identified, and the skin was marked for incision line. Skin preparation and draping were performed. A midline vertical skin incision was made, followed by fascia incision. The spinous process was palpated, and PVM (posterior vertebral muscle) separation was performed. Using a C-arm lateral view, the level was confirmed to be correct. The C2 lamina lower surface and C6 lamina upper surface were exposed, and a Beckmann retractor was installed. The patient\\u2019s left side lamina was cut using a cutting burr and diamond burr. The cutting burr was used to remove outer cortical bone and cancellous bone, while the diamond burr was used to remove inner cortical bone. A Penfield #4 dissector was used to confirm that the lamina was completely separated. On the patient\\u2019s right side, the outer cortical bone and cancellous bone were removed, leaving a thin shell of inner cortical bone. The spinous process was shifted from the patient\\u2019s left to right to induce a greenstick fracture. The dural sac was visualized beneath the elevated lamina, with satisfactory pulsation. The fracture site was confirmed to not extend inward. A Medtronics laminoplasty plate (10 mm length) was placed between the expanded laminae and secured with 5 mm screws. At C3 and C5, one screw was placed in the lateral mass and one in the lamina; at C4, two screws were placed in the lateral mass and one in the lamina. The laminae were confirmed to be securely fixed. Copious saline irrigation was performed. Minimal epidural bleeding was observed. Hemovac drains were inserted into both PVM gutters. Layered closure was performed in the order of muscle, fascia, subcutaneous layer, and skin. The patient was positioned supine with an MJ collar applied.  \\n**Immediate Postoperative Condition:** Uncomplicated.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 7:42:00 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

No intraoperative findings of dural tear were observed.  \\nOperative Procedure:  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the prone position. Standard methods were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the levels of C4-5-6-7 were confirmed. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made above and below, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the facet joints of C4-5-6-7. The spinous processes of C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed. With caution for spinal cord compression and dural tear, the laminae of C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed using a burr. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches. Two K-wires were inserted into each lateral mass of C4, C5, C6, and C7. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites. Based on this, lateral mass screws were inserted. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. The right iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. Using a burr, the cortical bone of the lateral masses of C4-5-6-7 was decorticated. The local bone and iliac bone were mixed and used as a graft. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing to complete the surgery.  \\n\\nThrombin 1ea  \\nGuardix 3g 1ea  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nTime of Writing: DATE 17:06\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5 level was confirmed. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made above and below the level, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the laminae and facet joints of C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5. The spinous processes of C3, C4, and C5 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae of C3, C4, and C5. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches. Six K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, and C5. The lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed using a C-arm. Based on these findings, lateral mass screws were inserted. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. A right iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. The cortical bone of the lateral masses of C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5 was decorticated using a burr. The harvested iliac bone and local bone were mixed and used as a graft. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing, concluding the procedure.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Time of Writing:** [DATE] at 4:54 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. A C-arm was utilized to confirm the C6/7 level, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision. The fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina posteriorly and the facet joint, revealing the C6/7 facet joint. After removing the spinous processes of C6 and C7, total laminectomy of C6 and partial laminectomy of C7 were performed while carefully avoiding cord compression and dural tear. Additional decompression was achieved using punches around the spinal cord. Four K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C6 and C7, and the lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed using a C-arm. The rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. A right iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. Cortical bone from the lateral masses of C6/7 was decorticated using a burr, and the local bone was mixed with the iliac bone for grafting. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac lines. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The layers were closed sequentially, and the surgical site was dressed with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] at 5:54 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

After decompression, the spinal cord was released, and root-free status was confirmed.  \\n2. No intraoperative findings of dural tear were observed.  \\nOperative Procedure:  \\n1. The patient was placed in the prone position on the spinal table under general anesthesia. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. The C3-4-5-6 level was confirmed using a C-arm. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made above and below the level, and the fascia was divided.  \\n2. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the facet joints of C3-4-5-6.  \\n3. The spinous process at the target level was removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear, and a burr was used to perform laminectomy at C3-4-5-6.  \\n4. Additional decompression around the spinal cord was performed using punches. Eight K-wires were inserted into the laminae of C3-4-5-6. The screw insertion sites were confirmed using a C-arm, and vertex screws were inserted.  \\n5. The right iliac bone was harvested from the PSIS area to prepare the bone graft.  \\n6. A CG DBM (5cc) was used to perform bone grafting at C3-4-5-6.  \\n7. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines and one JP drain were placed at the iliac bone harvest site.  \\n8. The wound was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing. Philadelphia straps were applied, and the surgery was concluded.  \\nThrombin (2 units), [BRAND] (6g, 1 unit)  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: [DATE]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3-4-5-6 level was confirmed, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision along the previous incision site. Fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina and facet joint at C3-4-5-6. After removing the spinous processes at C4 and C5, the cord compression and dural tear were carefully monitored while using a burr to remove the laminae at C3, 4, 5, and 6. Additional decompression was performed around the cord using punches. The lateral masses of C3-4 were decorticated with a burr, and local bone mixed with iliac bone was used as a graft. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac lines. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, and occlusive dressing was applied to complete the surgery.  \\n\\nCG bio  \\nCGDBM 5cc (x1)  \\nThrombin (X4)  \\nSpongostan (x4)  \\nGuardix 3g (X1) [bone graft material]  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: [DATE] 12:44 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

After Decompression, the spinal cord was released, and dural pulsation was confirmed.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was positioned prone. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6\\u2013C7 levels were identified. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made below C4\\u2013C5, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the laminae and facet joints of C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6\\u2013C7. The spinous processes of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches. Ten K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which guided the placement of the screws. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. Subsequently, the left iliac crest bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. Using a burr, the cortical bone of the lateral masses of C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6\\u2013C7 was decorticated, and the local bone graft was placed. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. The wound was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.  \\n**Described by:** R1.

Two K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C4, C5, C6, and C7. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, and screws were placed accordingly. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. Pedicle screws were inserted at T2-3. An iliac bone harvest was performed to prepare bone graft material. The cortical bone of the lateral masses of C4-5-6-7 was decorticated using a burr. Local bone and iliac bone were mixed and used as graft material. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac drains were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and dressed with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.  \\nThrombin 1ea, Guardix 3g 1ea, BonGros 10cc  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: DATE 00:58\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Screws were inserted with entry at the midpoint of each lateral mass, using a sagittal angle of 20' and axial angle of 20' in a bicortical fashion. Screws were connected to a rod.  \\n4. C2-C6 spinous processes were removed using a rongeur and punch, collected for future fusion. The exposed lateral mass and posterior column were drilled and decorticated.  \\n5. Laminae and remaining posterior arch from C7 level were removed using a punch and rongeur, exposing ligamentum flavum and epidural fat. These were removed to expose the dural sac, which showed minimal pulsation and a severely narrowed canal. C2-C6 laminectomy was completed with a punch, confirming no bleeding.  \\n6. Autologous bone collected for posterior fusion was decorticated and placed over the decorticated lateral masses. Right thenar MEP remained stable, while left thenar amplitude slightly increased. No significant IOM changes were observed.  \\n7. A 1ea Hvac insertion was performed, followed by layer-by-layer closure of muscle, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. Surgery concluded.  \\n8. Patient transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU).  \\nRecorded by: [NAME] [NAME]  \\nDate and Time: DATE 10:31 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Decompression revealed cord release and dural pulsation.  \\n2. No intraoperative findings of dural tear.  \\nOperative Procedure:  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C5-6 level was confirmed, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision. Fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C5-6 facet joint. After removing the spinous process, decompression was performed with caution for cord compression and dural tear using a burr to remove the lamina of C5-6. Additional decompression was performed around the cord using punches. K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C5 and C6, and the lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed using a C-arm. Lateral mass screws were then inserted based on this confirmation. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. Right iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. Cortical bone of the lateral masses of C5-6 was decorticated using a burr, and the graft was prepared by mixing local bone with iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-Vac lines. A single JP drain was inserted at the iliac bone harvest site. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, followed by occlusive dressing to complete the surgery.  \\n\\nThrombin 1 unit  \\nSpongostan 2 units  \\nOxiplex 1 mL  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: [DATE] 8:32 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position with neutral neck alignment and head fixation using a Mayfield carbon fixator. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was applied. Aseptic dressing and draping were performed.  \\n2. A midline skin incision was made to expose the cervical spine from C2 to C7 using a C-arm fluoroscope. Paraspinal muscle dissection was performed. The muscle adherent to the lamina was detached using a Penfield #1 retractor. The interlaminar space was dissected with a monopolar coagulator to fully expose the C2 to C7 levels.  \\n3. After level confirmation via C-arm fluoroscopy, pedicle screws (20mm poly) were initially inserted at the left C4,5,6 levels. A 2mm burr was used to create the screw trajectory, and the internal anatomy (e.g., arteries) was confirmed using a ball tip before insertion. Subsequently, pedicle screws were attempted on the right C4-5-6 levels. During insertion of the C5 pedicle screw, misalignment was detected via C-arm fluoroscopy. Reorienting the screw would risk pedicle fracture, so the right C5 pedicle screw was omitted.  \\n4. A rod was bent and inserted, followed by application of a cap. The final cap was tightened.  \\n5. A rongeur was used to remove the C3-4 spinous processes. A Kerrison punch and burr were employed to perform laminectomy at C3-4, exposing the spinal cord. The cortex around C3-C6 was partially removed using a burr, and autologous bone was placed on top.  \\n6. Massive saline irrigation and hemostasis were performed. Two H-vac devices were inserted, and the wound was closed in layers.  \\nIntraoperative IOM showed no changes. The patient was transferred to the ICU postoperatively.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nTimestamp: DATE 8:55 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose all facet joints, after which the spinous process was removed using a bone cutter.

Left-side lamina and lateral mass boundary delineated using a 3 mm cutting burr to leave an inner bony shell. The area fully excised with a 3 mm diamond burr, confirmed with Penfield #4 dissector. C7 lamina upper half removed with a 6 mm cutting burr, with remaining bony shell and ligament removed to expose the dural sac. C6-C7 ligament excised.  \\n4. Right-side inner bony shell preserved, spinous process displaced to create mobility. C7 lamina upper half removed using the same technique as the left side. Midline bone removed to ensure the C7 lamina cut sites meet. 6 mm cutting burr used to remove spinous process below, with Kerrison punch to eliminate structures compressing the dural sac. Bleeding at C7 lamina cut margin controlled with surgicel.  \\n5. Spinous process displaced from left to right to create a greenstick fracture. C2-C3 and C6-C7 ligaments severed with Kerrison punch to allow lamina flap expansion. Lamina thickness required 3 mm cutting burr to create space. C6 spinous process bulk reduced by cutting 1 cm below the tip, leaving lamina intact and spinous process tip near midline. C5 spinous process tip similarly trimmed.  \\n6. 12 mm centerpiece plate inserted at C3, C4, C5, and C6. Lateral masses and laminae secured with 5 mm screws.

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position with intraoperative monitoring (IOM) applied. Baseline motor evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were confirmed. The patient was then repositioned to the prone position with skull fixation. After slight neck flexion, no changes in MEP or SEP were observed, confirming stability. A partial posterior hairline shave was performed, followed by C-arm guidance to identify the C3-C6 level. A midline vertical skin incision was marked, and the area was prepared with betadine, painted, and draped aseptically.  \\n2. After skin incision, subcutaneous dissection was performed along the midline. The C2-C7 spinous processes were identified, and paraspinal muscles were dissected subperiosteally to expose the C3-C6 laminae and lateral masses.  \\n3. Under C-arm guidance, lateral mass screws were inserted into the right C4, C5, C6 and left C3, C4, C5, C6 (Vertex screws, Medtronics, M 3.5*14 - 6 pieces, M 4.0*14 - 1 piece (right C6)). The right C3 lateral mass screw insertion failed twice due to lateral displacement, with correction attempted but ultimately abandoned due to risk of vertebral artery or spinal cord injury.  \\n4. Under microscopic visualization, laminectomy was performed at C4-5, and partial laminectomy was conducted on the lower half of C3 and upper half of C6. After removal of the ligamentum flavum, the exposed spinal cord showed significant swelling but maintained good pulsation. Decompression of neural structures was confirmed, and meticulous hemostasis was achieved using agents such as Floseal. Autologous bone harvested during laminectomy was applied to the screw and rod insertion sites to promote bone fusion.  \\n5. A single H-vac line was inserted, and the wound was closed in layers.  \\n**Intraoperative Monitoring:** No changes observed; post-surgery, the patient regained consciousness and was transferred to the recovery room.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] at 5:39 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3-C7 level was confirmed, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision. Fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C3-C7 facet joints. Spinous processes of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear, with a burr used to remove the laminae of C3-C7. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punch instruments. Ten K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3-C7, and their positions were confirmed using a C-arm. Lateral mass screws were then inserted accordingly. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. The right iliac bone was harvested for bone graft preparation. Cortical bone of the lateral masses of C3-C7 was decorticated using a burr, and grafting was performed with a mixture of local bone and iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted, and one JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, followed by occlusive dressing to complete the surgery.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]  \\n**Time:** [DATE] [TIME]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A midline skin incision was made to cover the C2-7 area. Neck muscles were dissected midline to expose the C3-6 spinous process tips. Subperiosteal dissection of paraspinal muscles was performed to expose the C3-6 lamina.  \\n  3. **Main Procedure:** A cutting burr was used to remove the C3 lamina, followed by laminectomy. The ligamentum flavum was removed to achieve adequate decompression. For C4-6, the right side lamina was removed using a cutting burr, with some sections removed using a punch to create a gutter. The left side lamina was similarly processed using a cutting burr and punch to remove the lamina. Due to concern for kinking from the lamina at C4, laminectomy was performed. Decompression was achieved by retracting the lamina at C5-6. No dura tear or hinge fracture was noted across all levels.

Posterior screw fixation at C3-4-5-6 (lateral mass screw fixation)  \\n#. C3-5 total laminectomy, C6 upper portion partial decompression  \\n1. Patient placed in supine position under general anesthesia. Skeletal fixation performed, followed by skin preparation, betadine soaping, painting, and aseptic draping. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) applied. Initial bilateral deltoid and left thenar motor evoked potentials (MEPs) showed a reduction to approximately 80-100 \\u00b5V.  \\n2. C-arm confirmed for midline skin incision to cover C3-C6. Dissection followed the nuchal ligament. C3-C6 spinous processes and laminae were identified, and subperiosteal dissection was performed to fully expose the lateral masses of C3-C6.  \\n3. Entry points were placed 1 mm medial to the central point of the lateral masses, directed cephalad and laterally. A 2 mm cutting burr was used to create cortical entry points. Under C-arm guidance, screw guidance was utilized to create holes for screw insertion, followed by screw placement. Bilateral C3-C6 lateral mass screws inserted. (POSEIDON Cervical Screw System, 3.5*14 mm, 8 pieces, InoTh)  \\n4. A bent rod was connected to both sides of the screws for fixation. (Rod, 60 mm, 2 pieces)  \\n5. Using a Roungeur retractor, C3-5 spinous processes were removed. A 5 mm cutting burr was used to drill laterally to medially until the inner cortical bone of the laminae was exposed. Remaining bone was removed using a 1 mm or 2 mm punch, achieving total laminectomy at C3-5. C3 showed relatively less stenosis, while C5 exhibited more severe stenosis. C6 showed minimal stenosis, so partial decompression was performed on the upper portion using drilling and punching.  \\n6. Meticulous bleeding control was performed, followed by application of Floseal. Two H-vac devices were inserted, and wound closure was performed layer by layer.  \\n7. Intraoperative monitoring showed bilateral deltoid and left thenar MEPs increased to over 200 \\u00b5V and remained elevated until surgery completion.  \\nPostoperative: Patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: DATE, 5:11 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

No fracture was observed locally, and physical therapy was administered, but there was no improvement. Gait disturbance worsened, and starting 3 days ago, pain occurred in the left buttock area while walking, along with symptoms of decreased power transmission to the legs. The patient was referred to this facility. The patient reported experiencing gait deterioration for 1 year, attributing it to prior colorectal cancer surgery.

Sufficient decompression was confirmed. Both C3-4-5-6-7 facet joints were fused. No dural tear occurred during the procedure.  \\n\\n**Surgical Technique and Procedure:**  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position. Routine preparation and draping were performed on the cervical spine. Using a C-arm fluoroscope, the C3-4-5-6-7 levels were identified. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made above and below the target area, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the laminae and facet joints at C3-4-5-6-7. The spinous processes at C3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were removed. With caution for cord compression and dural tear, the laminae at C3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were removed using a burr. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punch instruments. K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The C-arm fluoroscope was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which were then used as a reference for screw placement. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. Both C3-4-5-6-7 facet joints were fused. Autogenous bone and demineralized bone matrix (DBM) at 5 mL were inserted into the fusion site. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-Vac drains were inserted. The surgical site was closed in layers and secured with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date and Time of Writing:** [DATE] at 4:00 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard techniques were employed for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C4-5-6 level was confirmed. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made above and below the level, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the laminae and facet joints of C4-5-6. The spinous processes of C4, C5, and C6 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae of C4, C5, and C6. Additional decompression was performed around the cord using punch techniques. Six K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C4, C5, and C6. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which were then referenced for screw placement. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed. The right iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. Using a burr, the cortical bone of the lateral masses at C5-6 was decorticated, and the local bone was mixed with the iliac bone graft. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The layers were closed sequentially, and an occlusive dressing was applied to complete the procedure.  \\n\\n**Implants**:  \\nVertex Screw 3.5 x 10mm (4ea), 3.5 x 12mm (2ea)  \\nThrombin 1ea  \\nGuardix 3g 1ea  \\n\\n**Author**: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Date**: [DATE]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

General anesthesia was administered, with evoked potential (EP) monitoring performed (4 extremities). The patient was positioned prone with head fixation using a MJ collar.  \\n2. Antiseptic dressing and draping were applied.  \\n3. A linear skin incision was made along the midline, extending from 4 cm below the inion to the C7 spinous process, measuring 12 cm in length.  \\n4. Midline dissection of the muscles was performed. Minimal bleeding was observed. Dissection was carried out laterally from the lateral margins of the spinous processes, using a osteotome for lateral retraction and Bovie electrocautery for coagulation and dissection.  \\n5. After confirming the anatomical levels, a 3 mm cut was made using a diamond burr. The right C4,5,6 laminae were removed medially, leaving only the inner cortical bone, while a laminotomy was performed on the left at the same level. The spinous process was shifted laterally to create space via a greenstick fracture of the laminae.  \\n6. Post-laminoplasty, the expanded space was confirmed. A double laminoplasty plate (Medtronics) was used to fix the C4,5,6 laminae in a spread position.

Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with intraoperative monitoring (IOM) applied. Baseline motor evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were confirmed. The neck collar was applied, and the patient was repositioned to prone. After skull fixation and achieving neutral position, MEP and SEP remained stable, confirming no change. The neck collar was removed. Partial shaving of the posterior neck area was performed, followed by C-arm guidance for level verification. Betadine soaping, painting, and aseptic draping were implemented.  \\n2. A midline vertical skin incision was made to cover the C3\\u2013C6 level. Paraspinal muscle dissection was performed to expose the bilateral laminae and lateral masses at C3\\u2013C6.  \\n3. Using a drill, pedicle screw entry points were created at the lateral margins of the bilateral C4 and C5 lateral masses. A 1 cm longitudinal skin incision was made 4 cm from the midline, bilaterally. A paramedian skin incision was prepared using a gearshift probe and hand drill for tapping, followed by uneventful pedicle screw insertion. (Vertex multi screw system, Medtronics, 18*3.5 (1ea), 22*3.5 (2ea), 24*3.5 (1ea). Subsequently, screw heads were connected using a rod and locked with a nut.)  \\n4. C4\\u2013C5 laminectomy was performed using Rounger and punch instruments. Ligamentum flavum was thoroughly removed to confirm the lateral margin of the thecal sac.  \\n5. Decortication was performed around the C4\\u2013C5 facet joints, followed by the application of autologous bone graft to promote bone fusion.  \\n6. Hemostasis was achieved using Surgicel (a hemostatic agent), and a single H-vac line was inserted.

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. A C-arm was utilized to confirm the C4-5 level, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision above and below the C4-5 level. The fascia was divided, and the paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. A subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina posterior and facet joints of C3-4-5-6. The spinous processes of C3, C4, C5, and C6 were removed. With attention to cord compression and dural tear, a burr was used to remove the lamina of C3, C4, C5, and C6. Additional decompression was performed around the cord using punch techniques. Eight K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, and C6. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which guided the placement of the screws. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. A left iliac bone was harvested for bone graft preparation. Using a burr, the cortical bone of the lateral masses of C4-5-6-7 was decorticated, and the local bone was mixed with the iliac bone for grafting. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and dressed occlusively to complete the procedure.  \\n\\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nTime of Writing: [DATE] [TIME]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Subsequently, the laminae at C4 were thinned using drilling to an eggshell form. A Kerrison rongeur was used to perform laminectomy at C4 in a manner similar to the C3 laminectomy, achieving decompression.

On October 20, 2019, weakness and paresthesia in the extremities developed, leading to hospitalization. The patient reported dizziness and generalized malaise around October 20, 2019, followed by tingling in the hands and feet. Symptoms progressively worsened, with the patient reporting increased tingling in the arms and legs. The patient now experiences difficulty walking without assistance and requires a wheelchair.  \\n\\n**Previous Hospitalization and Diagnostic Workup**  \\nThe patient was evaluated at [HOSPITAL] with Brain MRI and L-spine MRI, which showed no abnormalities. The patient reported cough and rhinorrhea 5\\u20136 days prior to symptom onset.  \\n\\n**Key Diagnostic Findings**  \\n**Spine MRI (October 30, 2019):**  \\n- Central canal stenosis with cord compression at C4/5 and C5/6.  \\n- Suspected cord signal change at C5 level.  \\n- Neural foraminal stenosis at right C3/4, bilateral C4/5, right C5/6, and bilateral C6/7.  \\n- Herniated intervertebral disc (HIVD) at L4-5.  \\n\\n**Brain MRI (October 30, 2019):** Unremarkable.  \\n**CSF Study (November 1, 2019):** Opening pressure 5 cm H2O, clear, R30W0, protein 50.8, glucose 80.  \\n**Nerve Conduction Study (November 5, 2019):** No significant abnormalities suggestive of peripheral neuropathy.  \\n**Metabolic Panel:** Vitamin B12 1396 pg/mL, Folate 21.1 ng/mL, HbA1c 5.6.  \\n**Immunologic Panel:** Anti-GD1b(-), anti-GM1(-), anti-GQ1b(-), GM1(-).  \\n\\n**Spine MRI (Cervical Extension and Flexion, November 12, 2019):**  \\n- Central canal stenosis at C3/4, C4/5, C5/6, and C6/7.  \\n- More pronounced on extension position due to ligamentum flavum buckling, central disc herniation/bulging, and retrolisthesis at C5/6/7.  \\n- Suspected cord signal change at C4/5.  \\n\\n**Current Problem List**  \\n- Rule out cervical myelopathy:  \\n  - Spine MRI suggests cord signal change at C5 level.  \\n  - Surgical intervention may have limited efficacy.  \\n- Rule out Guillain-Barr\\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS):  \\n  - 4/e distal dominant weakness and hypesthesia.  \\n  - Normal NCS findings.  \\n  - Low likelihood of GBS.  \\n\\n**Future Treatment Plan**  \\nThe patient was admitted to Neurology for evaluation of bilateral upper limb weakness, sensory abnormalities, and management. Initial workup, including metabolic, immunologic, and NCS studies, showed no abnormalities (NCS performed two weeks after symptom onset was also normal), reducing GBS likelihood. Cervical myelopathy was the only suspected diagnosis. Due to uncertainty regarding surgical intervention, the patient and family opted for observation. Persistent difficulty walking without assistance led to further imaging (spine MRI with extension/flexion and EP studies), confirming more severe stenosis. The patient and family provided surgical consent, and the case was referred for further treatment.  \\n\\n**Patient Equipment/Devices Provided with the Patient**  \\nNone specified.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]  \\n**Date:** [DATE]\",\n  \"OPERATIVE_NOTE\": \"Surgical Record (DATE)  \\nAuthor: [NAME]  \\nDepartment: [HOSPITAL] Neurosurgery  \\nProcedure Name: Laminoplasty, Cervical Spine  \\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Cervical Myelopathy  \\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Herniated Disc Disease of Cervical Spine  \\nAnesthesia Type: General  \\nSurgery Date: [DATE]  \\nSurgeon 1: [NAME]  \\nAssistant 1: [NAME]  \\nSurgery Start Time: [DATE] 09:13:00  \\nSurgery End Time: [DATE] 10:52:00  \\nIntraoperative Notes:  \\n- No surgical findings noted.  \\n- C4-5 laminoplasty & C6 upper partial laminectomy performed.  \\nProcedure and Technique:  \\n- Laminoplasty, C4-5 (Right side lamina open) & C6 upper partial laminectomy.  \\n  - Preparation: Patient placed in prone position on spine table.

Iliac bone graft harvested from the right posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS).  \\n\\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position. Routine skin preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine. A C-arm was used to confirm the C3-4-5 level, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision. Fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina posterior and facet joint at C3-4-5. The spinous processes of C3, C4, and C5 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear, with partial laminectomy performed on the right side using a burr. Additional decompression was achieved using punches. K-wires were inserted into the right lateral masses of C3, C4, and C5, and their positions were confirmed with a C-arm. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed. Iliac bone graft was harvested from the right PSIS. Cortical bone from the facet joints of C3-4-5 was decorticated, and a mixture of local bone and allograft was used for grafting. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac drains. The wound was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing. Surgery was concluded.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Creation Time:** [DATE] 17:21\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Status post Hartmann's procedure ([DATE])  \\n\\nPatient with tetraplegia since 2006, diagnosed with posterior cord syndrome following surgery for posterior cord syndrome. Received rehabilitation and long-term care. Cystostomy initiated in 2007. During rehabilitation, partial range of motion in the upper extremities was possible, and oral intake was maintained. In April 2016, the patient was admitted to [HOSPITAL] via emergency room for pneumonia, intubated, and placed in ICU. Percutaneous Drainage Technique (PDT) was performed, and tube feeding was initiated. During the hospital stay, hematochezia led to a diagnosis of sigmoid colon cancer, and the patient was transferred to surgery for Hartmann's procedure ([DATE]). Currently, tube feeding is continued in the long-term care facility. Fever occurred intermittently for two weeks prior to admission, with worsening fever (>38\\u00b0C) three days before admission, accompanied by increased cough and sputum. The patient denies aspiration events but occasionally reports a sensation of choking. The patient is bedridden and communicates via facial expressions, leading to a ruling out of aspiration pneumonia via internal medicine consultation.  \\n\\n**Admission Course**  \\n># Aspiration Pneumonia  \\nPatient reports that when lying down immediately after left tube feeding, chest discomfort occurred. To mitigate this, feeding is slowed, and feeding is paused when chest discomfort is noted. Use of a T-piece with 1L oxygenation results in rapid improvement in oxygen saturation. Bronchoscopic toiletting was performed on July 22 and July 27. Empirical antibiotics (tazoperan) were administered from July 20 to August 1, with resolution of symptoms and decreasing CRP levels, leading to completion of acute pneumonia treatment.  \\n\\n># Rule out orthostatic hypotension  \\nSignificant blood pressure differences (SBP >20, DBP >10) between supine and seated positions are noted. Midodrine 1 tab twice daily is currently prescribed, but blood pressure variability persists.  \\n\\n># C3-4 Central Canal Stenosis  \\nMRI performed on [DATE] revealed findings suggestive of C4-5 compressive myelopathy sequelae, leading to tetraplegia. Neurosurgery consultation was sought, and the patient and guardian opted for surgical intervention. The patient was transferred to neurosurgery for further evaluation.  \\n\\n># Ileus  \\nAbdominal distension was noted on August 5, with percussion findings (+) and ileus confirmed on abdominal X-ray. NPO status was initiated. While ileostomy output and stool passage are present, ileus remains severe on follow-up X-ray, necessitating TPN and NPO except for medications.  \\n\\n**Key Laboratory Results**  \\n@ CBC (08.08): 7,770 \\u2013 11.9 \\u2013 208k \\u2013 6,689  \\n08.07: 5,780 \\u2013 11.8 \\u2013 195k \\u2013 4,179  \\n08.03: 5,300 \\u2013 11.1 \\u2013 185k \\u2013 4,075  \\n08.01: 8,230 \\u2013 11.2 \\u2013 180K \\u2013 7,061  \\n07.30: 5,400 \\u2013 11.1 \\u2013 210k \\u2013 3,947  \\n07.28: 4,920 \\u2013 10.9 \\u2013 216k \\u2013 3,680  \\n07.27: 4,610 \\u2013 10.5 \\u2013 221K \\u2013 3,217  \\n07.25: 3,970 \\u2013 10.3 \\u2013 237k \\u2013  \\n07.22: 6,240 \\u2013 9.9 \\u2013 252K \\u2013 5,148  \\n07.21: 6,930 \\u2013 9.7 \\u2013 214K \\u2013 5,890  \\n@ CRP: 19.78 \\u2192 9.99 \\u2192 1.65 \\u2192 0.86 \\u2192 0.78 \\u2192 0.48 \\u2192 0.30 \\u2192 0.27 \\u2192 0.15  \\n@ BUN/CR: 11/0.36 \\u2192 10/0.23 \\u2192 11/0.25 \\u2192 12/0.22 \\u2192 14/0.29 \\u2192 18/0.32 \\u2192 18/0.29 \\u2192 17/0.31 \\u2192 21/0.29  \\n@ Abdominal X-ray: Ileus  \\n\\n**Current Patient Status & Problem List**  \\nCurrent:  \\n#.

A left paramedian vertical skin incision was made. A tubular retractor was attempted but could not be placed due to insufficient muscle split. The incision was extended slightly superiorly and inferiorly. The ossified bone at the surface of C3-4 was removed, and the muscles were dissected from the periosteum to expose the C3-4 spinous process. The lateral masses of C3-4 were exposed through muscle dissection.  \\n3. The lower portion of the C3 lamina and the upper portion of the C4 lamina were carefully removed using a punch. The lamina was removed down to the level of the dura (LF) to decompress the thecal sac. The C3-4 lateral masses were drilled to create a fusion bed, and autologous bone was placed as an onlay graft.  \\n4. Hemorrhage was controlled, and saline irrigation was performed to confirm the absence of bleeding. A H-vac was placed, and the wound was closed in layers.  \\nNo significant intraoperative monitoring changes were observed.

No intraoperative findings of dural tear were observed.  \\n\\nOperative Procedure:  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C5-6 level was confirmed, and a midline longitudinal skin incision was made below and above C5-6. The fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina posteriorly and facet joints, revealing the C4-5-6-7 facet joints. The spinous processes of C4, C5, and C6 were removed, and care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae of C4, C5, and C6. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches, and sufficient decompression was achieved on the right side of C7. Six K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C4, C5, and C6, and their positions were confirmed using a C-arm. Lateral mass screws were then inserted based on these findings. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. Subsequently, the left iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. The cortical bone of the lateral masses at C4-5-6 was decorticated using a burr, and the graft was prepared by mixing local bone with iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac lines. A single JP drain was inserted at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and dressed with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.  \\n\\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nTime of Writing: [DATE]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned prone. Standard skin preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine.  \\n2. Using surface anatomy, the C3 and C7 levels were identified. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made, and the fascia was divided.  \\n3. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C3-C4-C5-C6-C7 facet joints.  \\n4. Level check was performed using a C-arm.  \\n5. The spinous processes at C4, C5, and C6 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae at C4, C5, and C6.  \\n6. Additional decompression was performed using punches around the cord, and partial laminectomy at C3 and C7 was completed.  \\n7. Lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed at the bilateral lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, and C6. Lateral mass screws were inserted. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed.  \\n8. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted.  \\n9. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, followed by occlusive dressing to complete the surgery.  \\n\\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: DATE 10:37 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Posterior instrumentation with fusion using bone graft (iliac bone and local bone) at C2\\u2013C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6  \\n**Postoperative Diagnosis:** Same as above  \\n**Operative Findings:**  \\n1. After decompression, the spinal cord was released, and dural pulsation was confirmed.  \\n2. The surgery was performed under SEP (somatosensory evoked potential) and MEP (motor evoked potential) monitoring; no abnormal SEP or MEP findings were observed during the procedure.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was positioned prone. Standard skin preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine. A C-arm was used to confirm the C2\\u2013C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6 level, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision. The fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina and facet joints at C2\\u2013C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6. The spinous processes at C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5 were removed, and care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the lamina at C3\\u2013C4\\u2013C5. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches. K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, and C6. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which were then referenced for screw placement. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. The right iliac bone was harvested for bone graft preparation. The cortical bone of the lateral masses at C2\\u2013C6 was decorticated using a burr, and the graft was prepared by mixing local bone with iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac lines. A single JP drain was inserted at the iliac bone harvest site. The surgical site was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.  \\n\\n**Supplies:**  \\n- Thrombin: 2 units  \\n- Spongostan: 4 units  \\n- Guardix: 6 mL (hemostatic agent)  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Creation Time:** [DATE] at 02:29 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The SEP showed reduced amplitude across all limbs, while the MEP demonstrated low amplitude in the bilateral deltoid muscles, with no other significant findings. The patient was placed in the prone position after wearing a cervical orthosis.  \\n1. Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned in the prone position with head fixation.

A midline skin incision was made, followed by paraspinal muscle splitting and exposure of the C3-5 spinous process tip. A C-arm was used for level confirmation.  \\n3. Using a Penfield dissector No. 1, the muscle attached to the lamina was detached, and dissection was performed around the interlaminar space using a monopolar cautery to isolate the multifidus muscle. The entire lamina of C3-4 was exposed.  \\n4. The C3-4 spinous processes were removed using a rongeur, and the lower part of the bilateral C3 lamina and the upper part of the C4 lamina were removed with a punch to expose the spinal cord. The cord was pale and swollen. Adequate cord decompression and satisfactory dural sac pulsation were confirmed. Surgicel (a surgical hemostatic agent) and Floseal (a tissue adhesive) were applied for hemostasis.  \\n5. After massive saline irrigation and hemostasis, two hemovac lines were inserted, and the wound was closed in layers. No intraoperative monitoring (IOM) changes were noted.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nTime of Writing: [DATE] 7:25 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae of C3, C4, C5, and C6. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches. Eight K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, and C6. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which were then referenced for screw placement. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed. The left iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. The cortical bone of the lateral masses at C3-4-5-6 was decorticated using a burr, and the graft was prepared by mixing local bone with iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac drains were inserted, and one JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. Layered closure was performed, followed by occlusive dressing, and the surgery was concluded.  \\nDescribed by R1. [NAME] M.D.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nDate: DATE\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

After decompression, the spinal cord was released, and dural pulsation was confirmed.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nThe patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3-C4-C5-C6-C7 levels were identified. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made below C4 and above C5. The fascia was divided, and the paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C3-C4-C5-C6-C7 facet joints. The spinous processes of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae at C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches. Ten K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites. Based on this, lateral mass screws were inserted. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. The left iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. The cortical bone of the lateral masses at C3-C4-C5-C6-C7 was decorticated using a burr, and the autologous bone graft was placed. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemovac drainage lines were inserted. The wound was closed in layers and dressed with an occlusive dressing to complete the surgery.  \\n**Documented by:** [NAME]  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Creation Time:** [DATE] at 11:08 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A partial laminectomy was performed at the lower 2/3 of C3 using a drill and punch. The lamina and lateral mass boundary at the left side of C4 was opened using a drill and punch, followed by a laminectomy at C5. The lamina and lateral mass boundary at the left side of C6 was similarly opened. The exposed dural sac showed mild dorsal bulging under elevated pressure, but pulsation normalized after laminectomy.  \\n4. A hinge side was formed at the right lamina and lateral mass boundary of C4 and C6 using a drill, followed by laminoplasty using a plate and screws. No hinge side fracture occurred.  \\n5. Meticulous saline irrigation was performed, and bleeding control was achieved using Floseal (surgical adhesive).

Standard skin preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the levels C2-3-4-5-6 were confirmed. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made, and the fascia was divided. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous processes and interspinous ligaments to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the laminae and facet joints up to C2-3-4. The spinous processes at C3, C4, C5, and C6 were removed, and the laminae at these levels were removed using a burr while carefully avoiding cord compression and dural tear. Additional decompression was performed using punches around the spinal cord. Three K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C4, C5, and C6, and the lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed using a C-arm. The cervical lordosis was respected, and the rod was bent for instrumentation. Local bone and allograft were used for grafting. The incision was extended distally to access T1 and T2 levels, and the facet joints at these levels were exposed using the same method. The laminae at T1 and T2 were removed using a burr, and further decompression was performed with punches. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, and two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and dressed with an occlusive dressing to complete the procedure.\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Posterior instrumentation with fusion using bone graft (iliac bone and local bone) at C7-T1  \\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Same as above  \\nOperative Findings:  \\n1. Severe cord compression observed; decompression revealed a distended dura.  \\n2. No intraoperative findings of dural tear.  \\nOperative Procedure:  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was positioned prone. Standard skin preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C7-T1 level was confirmed. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made above C7-T1, and fascia was divided. Paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C7-T1 facet joint. The spinous process at C7-T1 was removed, and a total laminectomy was performed with caution for cord compression and dural tear. During posterior decompression, severe cord compression was observed, with distended dura noted. A single K-wire was inserted into each lateral mass of C7-T1, and the lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed using a C-arm. Lateral mass screws were then inserted based on this confirmation. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation.  \\nFollowing this, the right iliac bone was harvested to prepare the bone graft. Using a burr, cortical bone from the lateral masses of C7-T1 was decorticated, and the graft was prepared by mixing local bone with iliac bone.  \\nCopious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. Two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing to complete the surgery.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: DATE 04:49 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

After decompression, the spinal cord was released, and dural pulsation was confirmed.  \\n2. No intraoperative findings of dural tear were observed.  \\n3. During pedicle screw insertion at right C3 and C6, bone resistance was insufficient, leading to a crack; fixation was not performed.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position. Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3-4-5-6-7 level was confirmed, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision and fascia division. Paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina posterior and facet joints of C3-4-5-6-7. The spinous processes at C4-5-6 were removed, and decompression was performed cautiously to avoid cord compression and dural tear using a burr for partial laminectomy at C3 and C7, and total laminectomy at C4, 5, 6. Additional decompression was achieved using a punch. K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3-4-5-6-7. The lateral mass screw insertion sites were confirmed with a C-arm. Lateral mass screws were then inserted, but during screw placement at right C3 and C6, bone cracks occurred, necessitating screw removal. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. Right iliac bone was harvested for bone graft preparation. Cortical bone from the lateral masses of C3-4-5-6-7 was decorticated using a burr, and local bone was mixed with iliac bone for grafting. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac lines. The wound was closed in layers and secured with an occlusive dressing.  \\n**Authored by:** [NAME]  \\n**Surgical Materials:**  \\n- Prima OCT screw 3.5 x 12mm (5 pieces)  \\n- Prima OCT screw 3.5 x 14mm (3 pieces)  \\n- Rod (80mm, 60mm)  \\n- Genesis sponge block  \\n- Thrombin  \\n- Guardix  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date Written:** [DATE] at 5:06 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A herniated disc at C5-6-7 was observed to be compressing the spinal cord. A thorough decompression was performed.  \\n2. During decompression, the ligamentum flavum was found to be severely adhered to the spinal cord. Due to the risk of cord injury, it could not be completely removed, and only the maximum feasible removal was performed.  \\n3. No definite neurovascular stricture, trachea, esophagus, or spinal cord dura injury occurred during the procedure.  \\nOperative Procedure:  \\nThe patient was placed under general anesthesia in the supine position with the neck in a neutral position. Standard skin preparation and draping were performed.  \\nAfter confirming the C5-6-7 level with a C-arm, a transverse skin incision of approximately 3 cm was made on the anterior left side. The platysma muscle was transversely incised and dissected, retracting the trachea and esophagus to the right and the left longus coli muscle to the left to expose the C5-6 vertebral body and disc. The vertebral body was palpated, and a needle was inserted into the disc space for confirmation via portable X-ray.  \\nThe C5-6-7 disc space was exposed, and a microscopic discectomy was performed. A mini-incision was used to harvest iliac cancellous bone graft, which was then cut to fit the disc space and inserted for fusion. Subsequently, an anterior plate was fixed at C5-6-7 under C-arm guidance.  \\nMassive irrigation and hemostasis were performed, followed by Hemovac suction. The wound was closed in layers, and a Philadelphia brace was applied.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nDate of Writing: [DATE] at 11:42 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

After removing the spinous processes, the spinal cord compression and dural tear were carefully monitored, and the laminae at each level were removed using a burr. Additional decompression of the spinal cord was performed using punches. Eight K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C4, C5, C6, and C7. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which were then referenced for screw placement. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. A right iliac bone graft was harvested and prepared. The cortical bone of the lateral masses at C4\\u2013C5\\u2013C6\\u2013C7 was decorticated using a burr, and the local bone graft and iliac bone graft were mixed and implanted.

No intraoperative findings of dural tear were observed.  \\nOperative Procedure:  \\nUnder general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position, and routine preparation and draping were performed for the Cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the levels of C2-3-4-5-6-7 were confirmed, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision. The fascia was divided, and the paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina and facet joints of C2-3-4-5-6-7. The spinous processes of C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed. With attention to cord compression and dural tear, the lamina of C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed using a burr. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches. Two K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7, and the C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites. These sites were referenced for screw insertion. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed. The right iliac bone was harvested for bone graft preparation. Using a burr, the cortical bone of the lateral masses of C3-4-5-6-7 was decorticated. The local bone and iliac bone were mixed and grafted. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac lines. A single JP drain was inserted at the iliac bone harvest site. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, and occlusive dressing was applied to complete the surgery.  \\nThrombin 1ea, Guardix 6g 1ea  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: [DATE] 10:23 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

An anterior approach was performed, revealing severe disc herniation at C4/5/6 levels. The spinal cord was severely compressed. All discs were completely removed.  \\n2. Tri-cortical block allograft bone was inserted into the C4/5/6 disc space.  \\n**Operative Procedure:**  \\nThe patient was placed in a supine position under general anesthesia. Aseptic technique was employed, and the anterior neck area was draped. The thyroid cartilage and upper margin of the clavicle were palpated to estimate the vertebral level. A transverse incision was made, and layers were deepened. The platysma was dissected, with the longus colli and carotid artery retracted laterally, and the trachea/esophagus retracted medially to expose the C4/5/6 vertebral bodies and intervertebral disc space. Using pituitary forceps and a curette, disc material compressing the spinal cord was thoroughly removed to achieve decompression. The spinal cord was severely compressed by the herniated disc, and decompression resulted in partial recovery of pulsation. Tri-cortical block allograft bone was inserted into the C4/5/6 disc space. Meticulous hemostasis was performed. C-arm imaging confirmed alignment of the cervical vertebral body and bone block. After massive irrigation, layers were sutured sequentially, and two lines of hemovac drains were inserted to complete the surgical procedure.  \\n**Materials Used:**  \\n- Tri-cortical block allograft bone: 1 piece  \\n- Spongostan: 2 pieces  \\n- Thrombin: 1 piece  \\n- Guardix: 3g, 1 piece  \\n**Author:** [NAME]  \\n**Completion Date:** [DATE]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The level was marked using a C-arm, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision and fascia division.  \\n> #3. Paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the facet joint, after which the spinous process was removed using a bone cutter.  \\n> #4. An incision was made on the right iliac crest for iliac bone harvesting. Cancellous bone was maximized and separately preserved.  \\n> #5. Using a rongeur and punch, the C3-4 spinous process and PLC were removed. Pedicle screws were inserted, and a rod was bent to match the normal lordosis and inserted.  \\n> #6. A partial laminectomy was performed on the C5 lamina.  \\n> #7. Nuts were applied, and the rod was fixed using a driver to complete instrumentation.  \\n> #8. The harvested iliac cancellous autograft was positioned in the lateral mass area, and a trimmed local autograft was also inserted.  \\n> #9. After irrigation, a drain was inserted, and the wound was sutured layer by layer.  \\n> #10. Occlusive dressing was applied. The area where the Mayfield frame was applied was disinfected with betadine gauze, followed by gauze and EB dressing.  \\n**Author**: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date Written**: [DATE] 02:46 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Fascia was divided, and paraspinal muscles were detached from spinous processes and interspinous ligaments to expose the spinous processes. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C3-4-5-6 facet joints. Spinous processes at C3-4-5-6 were removed, and care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae. Additional decompression was performed using punches around the cord. K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, and C6, and their placement was confirmed using a C-arm. Lateral mass screws were then inserted accordingly. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis for instrumentation. A right iliac bone was harvested for bone graft preparation. Cortical bone from the lateral masses of C3-4-5-6 was decorticated using a burr, and a mixture of local bone and iliac bone was used for grafting. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac lines. A single JP drain was placed at the iliac bone harvest site. The wound was closed in layers and covered with an occlusive dressing to complete the surgery.  \\n\\nThrombin (clotting agent) 2 units  \\nSpongostan (hemostatic sponge) 3 units  \\nOxiplex (hemostatic agent) 3 mL  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: [DATE] 1:30 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3-4 level was confirmed, followed by a midline longitudinal skin incision. The incision was extended upward and downward gradually. During soft tissue dissection, the approach was performed to detach the paraspinal muscles from the spinous process and interspinous ligament, exposing the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was carried out to expose the C3-4 facet joint. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear, with total laminectomy performed at C3 and partial laminectomy at C4. Fusion was then carried out at C3-4. The spinal cord and roots were confirmed to be free. A right iliac bone graft (IBG) was harvested. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-Vac drains. Layer-by-layer closure was completed, and occlusive dressings were applied to conclude the surgery.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date and Time of Writing:** [DATE] at 12:44 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Spinous processes of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 were removed. With attention to cord compression and dural tear, burr was used for total laminectomy of C4, C5, C6, and partial laminectomy of C3 and C7. Additional decompression was performed using punch around the cord. K-wires were inserted into lateral masses of C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7. C-arm confirmed lateral mass screw insertion sites, followed by screw placement. Pedicle screws were inserted into C7 bilateral.

Standard techniques were used for skin preparation and draping of the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the cervical spine level was confirmed, and a midline longitudinal skin incision was made above and below the level. The fascia was divided, and the paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina and facet joints of C3, C6, and C7. The spinous processes of C3 and C6 were removed, and care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear while using a burr to remove the laminae of C3, C6, and C7. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using a punch. Four K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C6 and C7, and their positions were confirmed using a C-arm. Lateral mass screws were then inserted based on these findings. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed. The right iliac bone was harvested for bone graft preparation. The cortical bone of the lateral masses of C6-7 was decorticated using a burr, and the graft was prepared by mixing local bone with iliac bone. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, and two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, followed by occlusive dressing, and the surgery was concluded.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME] / [NAME]  \\n**Time of Entry:** [DATE] [TIME]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Routine skin preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine. Using a C-arm, the C3-4-5 level was confirmed, and a midline longitudinal skin incision was made, extending the incision slightly upward and downward. During soft tissue dissection, the approach was performed to detach the paraspinal muscles from the spinous process and interspinous ligament, exposing the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the lamina posteriorly and facet joints up to C3-4-5. Care was taken to avoid cord compression and dural tear. Total laminectomy was performed at C3, and laminoplasty was performed at C4, 5. The spinal cord and roots were confirmed to be free. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, and two Hemo-vac lines were inserted. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, followed by occlusive dressing to complete the surgery.  \\nThrombin (brand name), Spongostan (brand name), Floseal 5ml (brand name)  \\nAuthor: [NAME]  \\nCreation Time: [DATE] 10:14 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia. Standard skin preparation and draping were performed for the cervical spine.  \\n2. A midline longitudinal skin incision was made at the C5-6 level using a C-arm for guidance, and the fascia was divided.  \\n3. The paraspinal muscles were detached from the spinous process and interspinous ligament to expose the spinous process. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the laminae and facet joints at C5-6-7.  \\n4. The spinous processes at C5 and C6 were removed. With caution for cord compression and dural tear, a burr, rounger, and bone cutter were used to remove the laminae at C5, C6, and C7. Additional decompression was performed around the spinal cord using punches.  \\n5. An uncoforaminotomy was performed on the left side at C6-7.  \\n6. Five K-wires were inserted into the lateral masses of C5 and C6 on both sides and C7 on the right. A C-arm was used to confirm the lateral mass screw insertion sites, which were then used for screw placement.  \\n7. A 45-degree pedicle at the left side of C7 was punctured with a K-wire, and the screw insertion site was confirmed using a C-arm.  \\n8. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis, and instrumentation was performed.  \\n9. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed, followed by the insertion of two Hemo-vac lines.  \\n10. The layers were closed sequentially, and an occlusive dressing was applied to conclude the surgery.  \\n\\n**Instruments Used:**  \\n- ANAX OCT C-SPINE SCREW [U&I] 12mm (3)/14mm (2)/16mm (1)  \\n- ANAX OCT C-SPINE ROD [U&I] 50mm (2)  \\n- ANAX OCT C-SPINE NUT [U&I] 6  \\n- CG DBM allomix fiber 5cc *1  \\n- Thrombin *2  \\n- Spongostan *2  \\n- Mediclore (bone cement) 3cc *1  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] at 1:39 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Lateral mass screw insertion sites were identified on both lateral masses of C5 and C6, and lateral mass screws were inserted. #. Autologous iliac bone graft was harvested from the right ilium and placed into the disc space. #. A rod was bent to match the cervical lordosis and instrumentation was performed. #. Copious irrigation and meticulous hemostasis were performed. One Hemo-vac drain was inserted. #. Layer-by-layer closure was performed, followed by an occlusive dressing. #. The L4\\u20135 and S1 levels were confirmed, and a marking was made. A spinal needle was used to position the needle tip at the foramen. Dye was injected to confirm the needle tip was in the epidural space. #. Dexamethasone and lidocaine mixture was injected.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date Written:** [DATE] 3:58 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, patient was placed in prone position with head flexed and 3-pin head fixation. Standard aseptic draping was performed. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was applied.  \\n2. Midline skin incision was performed, followed by paraspinal muscle dissection to expose the C2-5 lamina. The C2 musculature included detachment of the interspinalis muscle and partial capitis muscle, while most muscles inserting on the lamina were preserved. The multifidus muscle was stripped from C5 to expose the C3-5 lamina.  \\n3. The C3 and C4 laminae were prepared using a 3mm cutting burr to create the left-sided bony gutter, with 1mm punch to remove bone and achieve an open configuration. The right side was symmetrically prepared with a 3mm burr, resulting in a greenstick fracture.  \\n4. Following partial removal of the ligamentum flavum between C4-5 via punch, a 10mm double-bend plate (Metronic, Centerpiece) was used to stabilize the C3 and C4 laminae. (Screws used were 5mm and 7mm in size.)  \\n5. After extensive saline irrigation and meticulous hemostasis, a single JP drain was placed, and the wound was closed in layers.  \\n6.

The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia. Skeletal fixation was performed, followed by betadine soaping, painting, and aseptic draping.  \\n2. After palpation to confirm C2 and C7, a midline skin incision was made to cover C3-C7. Trapezius, splenius capitis, and semispinalis muscles were dissected to expose C3-C6 spinous process tips. The interlaminar space was significantly narrow, and the bulk of the nuchal muscles made the surgical field deep, complicating the procedure overall.  \\n3. Periosteal dissection was performed along the lamina from the spinous process tips to dissect the multifidus muscles and expose the C3-C6 laminae.  \\n4. A 3mm cutting burr was used for drilling and punching to create bilateral gutters. The right side was opened, and the left side was fractured with a green stick fracture to laterally flex the lamina. C6 undercutting was performed. Remaining bone was carefully punched after drilling. A C5 hinge fracture was noted.  \\n5. A Centerpiece OD plate (Medtronic, 13mm, 3 pieces) was fixed to C3-C5 with screws. Centerpiece screws (Medtronic, 2.4 x 5mm, 12 pieces) were used for fixation.  \\n6. An H-vac (1 piece) was inserted, and the wound was closed in layers. Considering the patient\\u2019s high spinal level and quadriplegia, the risk of respiratory complications following surgery was noted. Extubation was avoided, and the patient was transferred to the ICU.  \\n* No microscopic images available.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: [DATE] 2:08 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position with head fixation using a Mayfield frame. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was installed, followed by aseptic draping.  \\n2. A midline, vertical skin incision was performed to include the C3-C7 level, with dissection and detachment of the muscles to expose the bilateral laminae and spinous processes.  \\n3. A high-speed drill was used to create holes in the C3-C7 laminae, forming a hinge site on the right and a gutter on the left. Using a dissector and punch, the gutter side was opened to expose the dura. A center piece plate and screws (Medtronics, 12mm) were applied for fixation, completing the open laminoplasty.  \\n4. Irrigation was performed, and a single closed drain was inserted. The wound was closed in layers, and the surgery was concluded.  \\nPostoperatively, the patient was transferred to the recovery room. No significant IOM changes occurred during the procedure.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nWriting Time: [DATE] 12:57 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

After administering general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position with neutral alignment maintained. The patient was secured using a horse-shoe headrest. Aseptic draping was performed.  \\n2. The C2-C7 spinal levels were confirmed via palpation and C-arm fluoroscopy. A midline vertical skin incision was made. The C2-C7 spinous processes were exposed, and the right-side musculature was dissected periosteally to expose the C3-6 laminae.  \\n3. The right C4 lamina was carefully removed using a punch. A dark red hematoma was identified within the epidural space, encased in a capsule. Due to the narrow window, total laminectomy was performed at C4-5 to address the most extensive hematoma. The left-side musculature was further dissected to expose the C4-5 laminae. Hematoma boundaries guided the punch technique for total laminectomy at C4-5.  \\n4. The exposed hematoma was removed along with its capsule for biopsy. Remaining hematomas were suctioned carefully. While C4-5 hematomas were fully removed, the hematoma extended below, necessitating an additional right C6 hemilaminectomy. The C7 lamina was partially removed to expose the hematoma, which was then excised via the laminectomy site. No hematoma was present at C3, so no intervention was performed there. Post-removal, the compressed dural sac returned to its normal thickness.  \\n5. Significant bone bleeding occurred during laminectomy, which was controlled using bone wax. Additional hemostasis was achieved with Floseal and Surgicel. A H-vac device was placed, and wound closure was performed in layers.  \\nThe patient was transferred to the recovery room after anesthesia was terminated.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nTimestamp: [DATE] 17:41\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A midline skin incision was made at the level of the C4-C7 spinous processes, followed by subperiosteal dissection to expose the C4-7 laminae to the boundary with the lateral masses.  \\n3. A trough was created at the boundary of the left C5-6 lamina and lateral mass using a drill. The lamina and lateral mass boundary was cut with a drill and punch, followed by removal of the ligamentum flavum and confirmation of the dural sac. The interspinous ligament was removed using a roungeur. The upper halves of both C7 laminae were removed using a drill and punch, and the ligamentum flavum was excised to confirm decompression of the dural sac.  \\n4. The spinous processes were retracted and fixed with two titanium plates to complete the open door laminoplasty at C5-6.  \\n5. Irrigation was performed, and one Hvac device was inserted.

C4\\u2013C6 spinous processes and laminae were identified, and subperiosteal dissection was performed to fully expose the lateral masses of C4\\u2013C6.  \\n3. The entry point was positioned 1 mm medial to the midline of the left C4 lateral mass. A 2 mm cutting burr was used to create an entry point in the cortical bone. Under fluoroscopic guidance, the superior inclination was aligned parallel to the lateral axis of the lateral mass, and the medio-lateral inclination was set at approximately 30 degrees. The cutting burr was positioned to enter halfway through the lateral mass.  \\n4. Screw guidance was used to create holes for screw placement, followed by screw insertion.  \\n5. The same method was applied for the right C4, both C5, and C6 lateral masses.  \\n   - **POSEIDON fixation screws 3.5 X 14 mm, 6 units**  \\n6. Using a Roungeur retractor, the C4\\u2013C6 spinous processes were removed. A 5 mm cutting burr was used to drill until the inner cortical bone of the laminae was exposed. Remaining bone, including the ligamentum flavum, was removed using a punch, achieving complete decompressive laminectomy.  \\n7. The screws were then connected with a rod.  \\n   - **Rod 60 mm, 2 units**  \\n8. A H-vac 1 unit was inserted, followed by layer-by-layer wound closure.  \\n9.

After general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the prone position with slight neck flexion and head fixation using the Mayfield head fixator. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) settings were established. Aseptic draping was performed as usual.  \\n2. Using a C-arm, a midline skin incision was made across the C3\\u20135 spinous process level. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose the C3\\u20135 lamina.  \\n3. Initially planned for C3/4 laminoplasty, the procedure was revised to laminectomy due to severe adhesion and spur formation in the C2\\u20134 right facet joint space. The C3/4 lamina and spinous process were removed using a punch. The ligamentum flavum was excised, and the dural sac was identified. Adhesion between the ligamentum flavum, dural sac, and surrounding structures made dissection challenging.  \\n4. A trough was created using a drill at the boundary of the right C5 lamina and lateral mass. The right C5 lamina and lateral mass boundary was cut using a drill and punch. The ligamentum flavum was removed, and the dural sac was confirmed. The interspinous ligament was excised using a roungeur.  \\n5. The posterior arch was elevated, and a 10 mm centerpiece OD (one piece) was placed to complete the open door laminoplasty at C5.  \\n6. Hemostasis was achieved using surgicel, and irrigation confirmed no active bleeding. A single Hvac (hemostatic agent) was inserted, and the wound was closed in layers.  \\n\\n**Intraoperative Monitoring:** No changes noted.  \\n**Postoperative:** Patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Time Written:** [DATE] 1:17 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A midline, vertical skin incision was made to include the C3-C7 level. The muscle was dissected and detached to expose both laminae and the spinous process.  \\n3. A high-speed drill was used to drill the C3-4 level, and the bone shell and LF were removed using a punch to perform a C3-4 laminectomy. Initially, cord pulsation was poor, but after laminectomy, the compressed cord was released, and pulsation was restored.  \\n4. Subsequently, C5-6 lamina drilling was performed. A hinge site was created on the left side, and a gutter was prepared on the right side. Using a dissector and punch, the gutter side was opened to expose the dura. A centerpiece plate and screws (Medtronics) were used for fixation, performing an open-door laminoplasty.  \\n   - OD plate (centerpiece): 10mm \\u00d7 2 pieces  \\n   - Screws (centerpiece): 2.5\\u00d75mm \\u00d7 8 pieces  \\n5.

The level was reconfirmed with the C-arm.  \\n3. **Laminectomy and Decompression:** A portion of the inferior C4 spinous process was removed using a rongeur and drill. The ligamentum flavum was excised to allow mobilization of the C5 lamina. A drill was used to create a hinge at the junction of the right C5-6 lamina and lateral mass. The left C5-6 lamina and lateral mass junction was cut using a drill and punch, followed by removal of the ligamentum flavum and confirmation of the dural sac. The superior lamina of C7 was removed using a cutting burr.  \\n4. **Laminoplasty and Fixation:** The posterior arch was displaced to the right and fixed with two 10mm open door plates.

Neck flexion was induced, followed by Mayfield skull fixation. C-arm lateral view was used for incision marking and partial shaving. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was set, and skin preparation and draping were performed.  \\n2. **Incision and Dissection:** A midline vertical skin incision was made, and bilateral PVM (posterior vertebral muscles) dissection was performed to expose the lamina from the lower margin of C2 to the upper margin of C7. C-arm imaging was used to confirm the level, and a cerebellar retractor was installed. Preoperative MRI showed a lesion between the C4 and C5 lamina on the right side, prompting a right-sided laminectomy. The laminectomy began at the C3 lamina, with the junction of the lamina and lateral mass cut using a 3mm cutting burr. Subsequently, a diamond burr was used, and the completeness of the cut was confirmed with a Penfield #4 dissector.  \\n3. **Left Side:** The inner bony shell was preserved, and the spinous process was displaced sufficiently. The bulky C6 spinous process, which obscured the C5 spinous process, was removed using a rongeur. The spinous process was shifted from right to left, creating a greenstick fracture. The lamina cut site and the ligament between C2-3 and C5-6 were severed using a Kerrison punch to allow the lamina flap to elevate properly.  \\n4. **Right Side:** A soft tissue mass ventral to the C4 and C5 lamina was removed using a Kerrison punch. The removed tissue appeared as thickened ligamentum flavum. After its removal, the lamina flap expanded, revealing pulsatile dural sac activity.  \\n5. **Instrumentation:** A 12mm centerpiece plate was applied, and 5mm screws were used for fixation. The lamina flap was securely fixed without depression at the fracture site. Saline irrigation was performed for hemostasis, and hemovac drains were placed in the bilateral PVM gutter. The wound was closed in layers.  \\n**Intraoperative Monitoring:** Baseline IOM showed response to U/E (upper extremity) stimulation but no response to L/E (lower extremity). No changes were noted during the procedure.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 8:02 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Subsequently, movement of the lower extremity resumed, accompanied by severe tingling and pain in both arms.  \\n\\nBased on the above findings, the patient was transferred to the emergency department of [HOSPITAL] for cervical spine CT and MRI, which showed no fractures or dislocations but revealed a cord signal change in C3-6. Due to the location, the patient was transferred to this facility.  \\n\\n**Past Medical History**  \\n- Others: Hypertension/Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus/Dyslipidemia/Cardiac disease/Cerebrovascular accident (all negative)  \\n- Previous treatment at other hospital: None  \\n\\n**Current Medications:** None  \\n\\n**Social History**  \\n- Alcohol: 1-2 times/week, 1 bottle of soju  \\n- Smoking: 1 pack per day for 30 years  \\n- Right-handed  \\n- Occupation: Furniture design/manufacturer  \\n\\n**Family History**  \\n- Hypertension: Negative  \\n- Diabetes Mellitus: Negative  \\n- Cancer: Negative  \\n- Others: Negative  \\n\\n**Non-Attributable (SpA)**  \\n\\n**ROS (Review of Systems)**  \\n- Dyspnea: Negative  \\n\\n**PE (Physical Examination)**  \\n- KPS: 40  \\n- mRS: 5  \\n- Alert, oriented to time/place/person  \\n**Motor Function**  \\n- U/E (Upper Extremity): SA IV/IV, EF IV/IV, WE IV/IV, WF IV/IV, EE IV/IV, Hand grasp III/III  \\n- L/E (Lower Extremity): HF V/V, KE V/V, ADF V/V, BTDF V/V, APF V/V  \\n**Sensory Function**  \\n- Allodynia: Both upper arm ~ finger  \\n- Paresthesia: Both hand (mostly thumb, palm) > forearm, right > left  \\n- Hypesthesia: Negative  \\n**Gait:** Unsteady  \\n**DTR (Deep Tendon Reflexes)**  \\n- BJ (+/+) BRJ (+/+) TJ (+/+) KJ (+++/+++) AJ (++/++)  \\n**Pathologic Reflexes**  \\n- Hoffmann: Negative/Negative  \\n- Ankle clonus: Negative/Negative  \\n- Babinski: Negative/Negative  \\n**DRE (Digital Rectal Examination)**  \\n- Perianal sensation intact  \\n- Anal tone: Slightly decreased  \\n\\n**Assessment**  \\n- Rule out cervical cord injury  \\n\\n**Plan**  \\n- Admission / Close observation  \\n- Pain Control \\u2192 Start Gabapentin  \\n**Treatment Goal**  \\n- Pain management and focused observation of neurologic symptoms  \\n**Discharge Plan**  \\n- Discharge criteria: No acute complications  \\n- Discharge timing: Within 1 week  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]  \\n**Date and Time:** [DATE] 11:32\",\n  \"OPERATIVE_NOTE\": \"Surgical Record  \\n(Date: [DATE])  \\nAuthor: [NAME]  \\nDepartment: Neurosurgery  \\nProcedure: Cervical Spine Laminoplasty  \\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Sprain and Strain of Cervical Spine  \\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Sprain and Strain of Cervical Spine  \\nAnesthesia Type: General Anesthesia  \\nSurgery Date: [DATE]  \\nSurgeon: [NAME]  \\nAssistant Surgeon: [NAME]  \\nSurgical Record: Neurosurgery ([DATE])  \\nProcedure: Cervical Spine Laminoplasty  \\nPreoperative Diagnosis: Sprain and Strain of Cervical Spine  \\nPostoperative Diagnosis: Sprain and Strain of Cervical Spine  \\nAnesthesia Type: General Anesthesia  \\nSurgery Date: [DATE]  \\nPrimary Surgeon: [NAME]  \\nAssistant Surgeon: [NAME]  \\nSurgery Start Time: [DATE] 12:12:00 PM  \\nSurgery End Time: [DATE] 3:30:00 PM  \\nIntraoperative Notable Findings: No significant findings during the procedure > Laminoplasty of C3-C6 and upper lamina of C7 (decompression)  \\nSurgical Technique and Procedure:  \\n1. The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia. Head pinning was performed using the Mayfield head fixator. Intraoperative electrophysiological monitoring (EP) was applied, and betadine soaping, painting, and aseptic draping were performed.  \\n2. A midline skin incision was made to cover the C2-C7 level based on markings. Bilateral paraspinal muscle (PVM) dissection was performed to expose the C2-C7 lamina and spinous process.  \\n3. A cerebellar retractor was installed, and the level was confirmed using a C-arm lateral view.  \\n4. On the left side, the lamina and lateral mass boundary was approached using a 3mm cutting burr to remove the inner bony shell, followed by a 3mm diamond burr for complete removal. A Penfield #4 dissector was used to confirm the procedure. The upper half of the C7 lamina was removed using a 6mm cutting burr, and the remaining bony shell was removed with a punch to expose the lateral margin of the dural sac. The right side retained the inner bony shell, with the spinous process gently displaced to allow mobility. A similar approach was performed for the upper laminectomy of C7.  \\n5. The spinous process was displaced from the patient\\u2019s left to right to create a greenstick fracture. The ligament at the C2-C3 lamina cut site was severed using a Kerrison punch to ensure proper lamina flap expansion. The C6 spinous process was bulky, so it was cut 1cm below the tip, allowing the lamina to extend beyond while keeping the spinous process tip near the midline. A 12mm centerpiece plate was applied, with 5mm screws placed on the lateral mass and lamina. Due to insufficient fixation at C3, an additional screw was added. The C5 spinous process tip was also cut similarly to the C6. Saline irrigation was performed to control bleeding, and no fractured segments were noted. Hemovac drains were placed bilaterally beneath the PVM, followed by fascia, subcutaneous tissue, and skin repair in sequence.  \\nImplants Used: 12mm centerpiece OD plate (Medtronics), 4 pieces; 2.6*5mm centerpiece screws (Medtronics), 9 pieces.  \\nNo significant intraoperative changes were noted with the IOM. The patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nTimestamp: [DATE] 5:32 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Subperiosteal dissection performed to expose the C3-7 lamina to the lateral mass boundary.  \\n3. Interspinous ligament removed using a roungeur. Spinous process tips removed with a drill. Left C4-6 lamina and lateral mass boundary cut using a Misonix bone scalpel (a powered bone cutting device) and punch. Ligamentum flavum removed, and the dural sac confirmed. Right C4-6 lamina and lateral mass boundary hinged with a bone scalpel and folded laterally. Posterior arch tensioned and fixed with Centerpiece 3 pieces to complete open door laminoplasty at C4-6.  \\n4. Drilling and punch used to extend the laminectomy range horizontally along the exposed dural sac to the left lateral margin at C6-7. Left C7 root confirmed. Root exit zone probed to ensure adequate decompression.  \\n5. Irrigation performed, Hemovac 1 unit inserted, and layered wound closure executed. No IOM changes noted during surgery.  \\n6. Extubation performed, and patient transferred to PACU.  \\nInstruments:  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: [DATE] 3:40 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned prone with the head placed on a headrest in a slight concord position. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was applied, and antiseptic preparation and draping were completed.  \\n2. A midline vertical incision was performed to cover C5-T1. Periosteal dissection was carried out to expose the C6-T1 laminae and spinous processes.  \\n3. A rongeur was used to remove the C7 spinous process. Additional spinous process remnants and laminae were thinned using a cutting burr and diamond burr. The interlamina ligament between C6-7 and C7-T1 was removed with a rongeur and Kerrison rongeur. A T1 upper partial laminectomy was performed using a drill. Similarly, the C6 lower portion was partially drilled to perform a laminectomy. A Kerrison rongeur and pituitary forceps were used to remove the ligamentum flavum (LF) from the T1 site. The LF was tightly adherent to the dura and showed minimal epidural fat. Partial calcification of the LF was noted.  \\n4. After adequate decompression was achieved at the C7-T1 site, the remaining lamina at C7 was thinned using a fine hook to create space between the LF and dura. A Kerrison rongeur was used to perform laminectomy at C7. The LF was more firmly attached to the dura at C7, so a bone island was left to preserve the C6-7 site. The LF was removed using a Kerrison rongeur and rongeur, and the remaining C7 bone island was removed. The LF was detached from the dura using a lateral hook and fully removed.  \\n5. Adequate decompression was confirmed. Hemostasis was achieved using Floseal (a hemostatic agent). Two drains were inserted, and the wound was closed layer by layer. No intraoperative complications or significant IOM changes were observed. Due to the patient\\u2019s history of postoperative MI, the patient was intubated and transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) for further monitoring.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Time of Writing:** [DATE] [TIME]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) applied, followed by aseptic draping.  \\n   - Midline vertical incision from C4 to C7 performed, with subperiosteal dissection to expose the laminae.  \\n   - Interspinous ligament, spinous process, and soft tissues removed to expose the laminae. Hinge formation at the lateral mass boundary of C5\\u20136 using a drill. The right lateral mass boundary was cut with a drill and punch, with ligamentum flavum removal and thecal sac visualization. Dural pulsation was noted but mild.  \\n   - C7 upper lamina drilling performed for dome plasty, with thecal sac decompression confirmed.  \\n   - Posterior arch of C5\\u20136 lamina elevated and fixed with a plate and screws. C6 hinge site fracture occurred, leading to instability and lamina removal. C5 spinous process protrusion was addressed by removing the tip with a drill.  \\n   - Irrigation followed by H/V 1ea insertion and layer-by-layer wound closure. No significant IOM changes occurred during the procedure.  \\n\\n2. **ACDF, C5\\u20136**  \\n   - Patient repositioned supine with slight neck extension. C5\\u20136 level confirmed with a C-arm, and a skin crease marked for approach. IOM applied, followed by antiseptic and aseptic draping.  \\n   - Right paramedian transverse incision performed, with subcutaneous dissection to expose the platysma muscle. Transverse dissection exposed the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Dissection between the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid and infrahyoid muscle revealed the carotid sheath, esophagus, and trachea. Carotid artery retracted laterally, and esophagus/trachea complex retracted medially to visualize C5\\u20136 vertebral bodies (VB) and intervertebral disc. Longus coli muscles coagulated to create space.  \\n   - C-arm used for level confirmation. Caspar screws inserted into C5 and C6 VB, with CCR retractor placed. Bony spur at C5\\u20136 intervertebral space removed with a drill.  \\n   - Disc space confirmed under microscopic view. Annulotomy performed with a #15 blade. Disc material removed using pituitary forceps, punch, and curette. C5\\u20136 cartilage end plates prepared with a curette. Dorsal disc space expanded with drilling.  \\n   - Large herniated disc with severe adhesion noted. Posterior aspect of C6 VB upper margin drilled to create space, with disc material removed using punch and pituitary forceps. PLL compression identified, with OPLL confirmed at C6 VB posterior aspect. However, space was severely narrow, and adhesion was extensive, making removal difficult. Posterior decompression and herniated disc removal achieved sufficient thecal sac decompression, so further removal was avoided.  \\n   - Autobone graft prepared from removed bone block mixed with cage and inserted into C5\\u20136 intervertebral space under C-arm guidance. Plate fixed, and alignment confirmed with C-arm.  \\n   - CCR retractor removed, distractor and Caspar screws removed. Bleeding controlled with Floseal, and J-P drain inserted. Wound closed layer-by-layer. Skin closure performed with Steri-strip and skin bond.  \\n\\n**Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM):**  \\n- Preoperative IOM confirmed MEP with amplitude >200 in upper extremity deltoid to extensor, while thenar and lower extremity amplitudes were <50. SSEP showed normal range in left upper extremity, while right upper extremity was 50\\u201360% of left. Lower extremity findings were similar to upper extremity.

Due to bony fusion at C2-3, C3 Laminoplasty was replaced with Laminectomy. Some C2 undercutting was performed.  \\n\\nProcedure and Technique:  \\n1. After placing the patient in the prone position with head fixation under general anesthesia, the C3-7 level was confirmed using a C-arm. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was applied, followed by aseptic draping.  \\n2. The C3-7 level was confirmed using a C-arm, and a vertical midline skin incision was performed to include this range. The paraspinal muscles were dissected subperiosteally to expose the C3-7 laminae, with removal of the spinous processes and interspinous ligament.  \\n3. Due to bony fusion at C2-3, C3 laminectomy was performed using a drill and punch. Decompression was achieved by undercutting part of C2 in a cephalad direction.  \\n4. The lamina and lateral mass boundary at the left side of C4-6 was opened using a bone scalpel. A laminectomy of the left side of the C7 upper lamina was performed using a drill and punch, with confirmation of the dural sac.  \\n5. The lamina and lateral mass boundary at the right side of C4-6 was gently prepared using a bone scalpel to form a hinge side. A laminectomy of the right side of the C7 upper lamina was performed using a drill and punch, with confirmation of the dural sac. The remaining lamina and ligamentum flavum in the midline were removed to complete the C7 upper laminectomy.  \\n6. After retracting the left C4-6 lamina and removing the ligamentum flavum, laminoplasty was performed using a miniplate and screw. No hinge-side fracture occurred.  \\n7. The C6 spinous process was found to protrude to the right, and its tip was additionally removed using a drill. During this process, the C6-7 interspinous ligament was separated and removed.  \\n8. The exposed dural sac was decompressed and showed mild dorsal bulging, though pulsation was restored.  \\n9. Meticulous saline irrigation was performed, and a Hemovac suction drain (1 unit, 2 lines) was inserted. Layer-by-layer wound closure was performed. No changes in IOM were observed. The patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU.  \\n\\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nWritten Time: DATE 16:51\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A three-point Mayfield fixator was attached to the skull. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was applied. Aseptic draping was performed.  \\n# Approach: Palpation of C2-C7 was performed to confirm the level, followed by a midline skin incision to cover the C2-7 level. Neck muscles were dissected midline to expose the spinous processes of C3-6. Using a sagittal saw, the spinous tips at C3-6 were split left and right. Subsequently, paraspinal muscles were dissected subperiosteally to expose the laminae of C3-6. Based on spine MRI/CT imaging, laminoplasty was planned with the spinous process centered and a 18mm distance between the bilateral laminae.  \\n# Main Procedure: A cutting burr was used to first create a gutter on the left side lamina in the order of C6 \\u2192 C3 from the inferior aspect. The lamina was then removed using a punch. On the left side, a 18mm distance was maintained, and the same sequence was followed for the right side lamina using a cutting burr to create a gutter for hinge function. The lamina was then folded toward the right side to the extent that the dura was partially exposed, achieving decompression. No dura tear or hinge fracture was observed across all levels. A double-bent arch-lamino plate was fixed to the laminae, and during fixation of the plate at C5, there was a transient reduction in MEP (Motor Evoked Potential) but a recovery trend was observed.  \\n# Closure: After insertion of an H-vac 1ea, the wound was sutured layer by layer according to the anatomical layers.  \\n# Postoperative: The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nAuthoring Time: [DATE] 12:22 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, supine position was maintained. Intraoperative monitoring system was applied. Aseptic draping was performed.  \\n2. Using a C-arm, the cervical spine level was confirmed. A linear skin incision was made along the skin crease on the right side to expose the C4, C5, and C6 vertebral bodies. Soft tissue dissection was performed, incising the platysma muscle and dissecting the sternocleidomastoid muscle and carotid sheath laterally. The fascia and longus colli muscle were dissected to expose the C4, C5, and C6 vertebral bodies. A Casper retractor was used to ensure adequate surgical space.  \\n3. The C4-C5 intervertebral disc was identified and removed using a currette and pituitary forceps. Subsequently, a drill was used to remove the uncinate process and the posterior longitudinal ligament, confirming complete decompression of the thecal sac. An allograft bone of 6 mm height was designed to fit the intervertebral disc space and inserted. The same method was applied at the C5-C6 level, with an allograft height of 5 mm. An Atlantis plate (47.5 mm) was used for fixation of the C4, C5, and C6 anterior vertebral bodies.  \\n4. After bleeding control and irrigation, a single J-P drain was placed.

Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was applied. Aseptic dressing and draping were performed.  \\n   - **Incision**: A skin incision was made along the medial border of the right sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle using a C-arm to verify the level. Dissection of the platysma muscle was performed, followed by dissection along the SCM medial border. The omohyoid muscle was cut, and the carotid sheath was retracted to the right side. The esophagus and trachea were retracted to the left side. Partial coagulation of the longus coli muscle was performed, and a retractor was applied to visualize C4\\u2013C7. The longus coli muscle was markedly edematous. A Caspar screw was inserted, and the level was reconfirmed with a C-arm before distraction.  \\n\\n2. **Discectomy & Corpectomy**:  \\n   - **C5\\u2013C6 Discectomy**: A Kerrison rongeur, curette, and pituitary forceps were used to perform discectomy. A burr and Kerrison rongeur were used for C5 corpectomy. Severe bleeding was noted from the C5 vertebral body. The posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) was identified, followed by C6 corpectomy and C6\\u2013C7 discectomy. Excessive bleeding required use of bone wax, Flosseal, and a bipolar coagulator. No cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak was observed; the dura was pale with minimal pulsation.  \\n\\n3. **Instrumentation**:  \\n   - A 13\\u00d750 mm mesh cage filled with autologous bone and allograft bone chips was inserted into the C5\\u2013C6 corpectomy sites. A 70 mm-sized Atlantis plate and 14 mm screws were placed from C4 to C7. Meticulous hemostasis and copious saline irrigation were performed. A Jackson-Pratt (J-P) drain was inserted, and the wound was closed in layers.  \\n\\n4. **Posterior Fixation**:  \\n   - The patient was positioned prone, and the neck was placed in a neutral position. A Mayfield carbon fixator was applied. A C-arm confirmed coverage of C5 laterally but limited visualization of C7\\u2013T1 due to shadowing. Aseptic dressing was applied. An abrasion wound from trauma was noted on the posterior neck.  \\n\\n5. **Midline Incision & Spinal Exposure**:  \\n   - A midline skin incision was made from C2 to T2. Paraspinal muscles were split, and the spinous processes of C2\\u2013T1 were exposed. Soft tissue was markedly edematous with bruising.  \\n\\n6. **Laminectomy & Fracture Management**:  \\n   - Using a Penfield #1 and monopolar coagulator, muscles adherent to the lamina were detached. Multifidus muscles were dissected with monopolar cautery. A fracture line was observed at C5\\u2013C6, with significant bleeding managed using bone wax. CSF leakage was noted at the C5 lamina fracture site, and laminectomy was deferred due to risk of extensive CSF leakage. A Tachcomb was applied at the suspected leak site.  \\n\\n7. **Pedicle & Lateral Mass Screws**:  \\n   - Pedicle screws (3.5\\u00d720 mm) were inserted at C7 and T1 under C-arm A-P view. Screw placement at T1 was challenging due to poor visualization. Lateral views showed minimal coverage of C7\\u2013T1, necessitating blind screw placement. Lateral mass screws (3.5\\u00d714 mm) were inserted at C3\\u2013C4 under A-P and lateral views. Bilateral rods were placed, with lateral connectors securing the rods at C7. Cross-link insertion was performed.  \\n\\n8. **Closure**:  \\n   - Massive saline irrigation and hemostasis were achieved. Hemovac drains (2 units) were placed, and the wound was closed in layers.  \\n\\n**Intraoperative IOM**: No changes were observed.  \\n**Postoperative Care**: Patient was transferred to the ICU.  \\n\\n**Author**: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Creation Time**: [DATE] 6:39 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Laminectomy and syringo-subarachnoid shunt insertion at C3-4 level.  \\n**Surgical Technique and Procedure:**  \\n- **Preparation:** Patient placed in prone position on a general table. Skull fixation performed using a Mayfield fixator. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) settings established. Skin preparation and aseptic draping completed.  \\n- **Approach:** Palpation confirmed C2 and C6 levels. A midline skin incision was made to cover C3-6. Dissection followed the midline to expose the spinous processes of C3-6. C2-7 spinous processes were palpated for confirmation. Subperiosteal dissection was performed to expose bilateral C4-6 lamina. C-arm imaging confirmed the level. Laminotomy at C5-6 was performed using a cutting burr, Kerryson punch, and diamond burr.  \\n- **Main Procedure:** Under microscopic view, durotomy was performed and tacked with 4-0 silk for lateral retraction. Arachnoidotomy was performed, and the dura was tacked with 4-0 silk for additional retraction. A micro-retractor was used for further arachnoid dissection. Bilateral dorsal roots were identified, and a midline myelotomy was performed at C5-6. No significant IOM changes were observed. During dissection, the syrinx could not be identified. Dissection caused a 70% reduction in left thenar motor evoked potential (MEP) compared to baseline. Due to difficulty in locating the syrinx and the risk involved, the approach was shifted to a higher level. A skin incision was extended to expose the C2 spinous process tip. C3-4 spinous processes were removed using a rongeur, and laminectomy was performed at C3-4 using a punch. After bleeding control, durotomy and arachnoidotomy were extended upward. A midline myelotomy was performed at C3-4. Left thenar MEP decreased by 50% compared to baseline. Anteriorly and laterally dissection at the midline revealed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, confirming the syrinx cavity.  \\n- **Shunt Placement:** A Medtronic shunt catheter with a side hole was inserted into the syrinx. The catheter was tagged with 6-0 Prolene. The distal end was positioned in the ventral subarachnoid space.  \\n- **Closure:** Bleeding was meticulously controlled. The arachnoid and dura were closed watertight with 4-0 silk. C5-6 lamina was secured using a Cheil plate. A 2-lumen H-vac was inserted, and layered closure was performed. At the end of the procedure, left thenar MEP returned to the normal range. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 5:35 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A midline vertical skin incision was made, and bilateral paraspinal musculature (PVM) dissection was performed to expose from the lower margin of C2 lamina to the C6 lamina. Level confirmation was verified using a C-arm lateral view.  \\n3. Left-side lamina was cut at the junction of the lateral mass. The lamina lateral margin was identified using a Penfield #4 dissector, and a 3mm cutting burr was used to remove the inner bony shell, followed by a 3mm diamond burr for complete removal. Bone integrity was confirmed with a Penfield #4 dissector. The right side retained the inner bony shell to allow spinous process mobility.  \\n4. The spinous process was displaced from left to right to create a greenstick fracture. Ligaments at the lamina cut site, as well as those between C2-3 and C5-6 laminae, were removed using a Kerrison punch to ensure lamina flap mobility. A plate was tested, with 10mm appropriate for C3-4 and 12mm for C5. 5mm screws were placed on the lateral mass and lamina for fixation, confirmed as secure.  \\n5. Minimal bleeding was observed. Saline irrigation was performed, and hemovac drains were placed in both PVM gutters. The operating wound was closed layer by layer. No abnormalities were noted on baseline IOM, with no changes during surgery.  \\n*Instrument List: Center piece plate 10mm 2ea, center piece plate 12mm 1ea, center piece screw 2.6*5mm 6ea  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCreation Time: DATE 2:49 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Intraoperative photographs taken.  \\n**Surgical Technique and Procedure:**  \\n1. General Endotracheal Anesthesia (GEA) induction followed by patient positioning in the prone position on the operating table. The neck was flexed, and Mayfield skull fixation was applied. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was set up. A C-arm lateral view was used to mark the incision level, followed by partial shaving and skin preparation and draping.  \\n2. A midline vertical skin incision was made, and bilateral paraspinal muscle (PVM) dissection was performed to expose the lamina from the lower surface of C2 to the upper surface of C5. Cerebellar retractors were placed at the upper and lower corners, and the level was confirmed using a C-arm.  \\n3. Soft tissue between C2-3 laminae was removed to expose the ligament between the laminae. The lateral margin of the dural sac was identified using a Penfield #4 dissector, and the laminae were cut based on this reference point. A cutting burr was used to remove the inner bony shell, and a diamond burr was employed thereafter. The completeness of the cut was verified by passing a Penfield #4 dissector through the site.  \\n4. On the right side, the laminae were not completely removed; instead, the inner bony shell was retained, and the spinous process was mobilized to create mobility. The spinous process was displaced from left to right to induce a greenstick fracture. The ligament between C2-3 and C4-5 laminae was removed using a Kerrison punch to ensure proper lamina flap displacement.  \\n5. A 10mm centerpiece plate was placed at the lamina cut site and secured with 5mm screws on the lateral masses and laminae. The fixation was confirmed to be stable, and the absence of lamina intrusion into the fracture site was verified with saline irrigation. Minimal bleeding was observed. Hemovac lines were placed in both PVM gutters, and the wound was closed in layers. Intraoperative IOM showed no significant changes.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 11:23 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The patient was placed in the prone position under general anesthesia. A Mayfield fixator was used for fixation, followed by intraoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. Bethadine soaping, painting, and aseptic draping were performed.  \\n2. Using a C-arm and palpation, C2 and C7 were identified. A midline skin incision was made to cover the C2\\u20137 level. The trapezius, splenius capitis, and semispinalis muscles were split to expose the C2\\u20137 spinous processes.  \\n3. For C2 undercutting, a portion of the C3 spinous process was removed. The C2 lamina lower surface was thinned using a cutting burr and diamond burr, with the remaining bony shell lifted and removed. After removing the remaining lamina (LF), the dural sac was visualized.  \\n   - The left side lamina and lateral mass boundary was trimmed with a 3mm cutting burr, leaving only the inner bony shell. A 3mm diamond burr was used for complete removal, confirmed with a Penfield #4 dissector.  \\n   - The C7 lamina upper half was removed using a 6mm cutting burr, with the remaining bony shell and ligament removed to expose the dural sac. The ligament between C6\\u20137 lamina was excised.  \\n4. On the right side, the inner bony shell was retained, and the spinous process was displaced to create mobility. The C7 lamina upper half was removed similarly to the right side. The midline bone was removed to ensure the C7 lamina upper side removal sites met. A 6mm cutting burr was used to remove the spinous process below, and a Kerrison punch was used to remove bone, ensuring no structures compressing the dural sac remained.  \\n5. The spinous process was displaced from the patient\\u2019s left to right to create a greenstick fracture. The ligament between C6\\u20137 lamina and the lamina cut site was severed with a Kerrison punch to allow the lamina flap to spread. The C spinous process tip was cut to position it near the midline.  \\n6. 12mm diameter centerpiece plates were placed at C4\\u20135\\u20136, and a 10mm plate at C3. Each lateral mass and lamina received a 5mm screw for fixation. Bleeding from the epidural vein at the lamina cut site was controlled with bipolar coagulation. The thecal sac was visualized, confirming adequate decompression. No hinge fracture was observed.  \\n   - Equipment: Medtronic 12mm diameter centerpiece plate (3 units), Medtronic 10mm diameter centerpiece plate (1 unit), Medtronic 5mm*2.6mm screws (8 units).  \\n7. After inserting two Hemovac drains, the wound was closed in layers. No changes in intraoperative monitoring (IOM) were noted compared to baseline. The patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 6:08 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A three-point Mayfield fixator was attached to the skull. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was applied. Aseptic draping was performed.  \\n# Approach: C-arm was used to confirm the C2 level, and C7 palpation was performed to confirm the C2-C7 level. A midline skin incision was made to cover the C2-C7 level. Neck muscles were dissected midline to expose the C3-C6 spinous process tips, and paraspinal muscles were subperiosteally dissected to expose the C3-C6 lamina.  \\n# Main Procedure: A high-speed drill was used to drill the C3-C6 lamina, creating a hinge site on the right and a gutter on the left. The lamina was retracted to the right side to achieve decompression, and the inferior part of the opened lamina was partially removed using a dissector and punch to fully detach the dura and lamina. C3 to C6 was sequentially performed using center piece plate & screw (Medtronic brand) for open door laminoplasty. No dura tear or hinge fracture was observed across all levels. The C7 upper lamina was removed using a burr, and the thin bony shell and ligament were removed to achieve decompression.  \\n# Closure: Hemovac lines were placed in both PVM gutters, and the wound was closed with sutures according to anatomic layers.  \\n# Postoperative: Patient was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) while maintaining intubation. During the left gutter creation, Lt thenar EMG showed 3-4 episodes but resolved.

General Endotracheal Anesthesia (GEA) induction followed by prone positioning on the operating table. Mayfield skull fixation was applied in the neck flexion position. The incision level was marked using a C-arm lateral view, followed by partial shaving. A midline vertical skin incision was performed, and bilateral paraspinal musculature (PVM) dissection was conducted to expose from the lower surface of C2 lamina to the upper surface of C7 lamina. The level was confirmed using a C-arm.  \\n2. The right lamina and lateral mass boundary was contoured with a 3mm cutting burr to leave only the inner bony shell, then completely cut using a 3mm diamond burr. A Penfield #4 dissector was passed to confirm the procedure. The left side retained the inner bony shell while the spinous process was displaced to induce mobility. The spinous process was displaced from the patient\\u2019s right to left side, creating a greenstick fracture. The ligament between C2-3 and C6-7 lamina cut sites was severed using a Kerrison punch to allow the lamina flap to spread. The C6 spinous process was bulky, so it was cut 1cm below the tip, ensuring the lamina extended beyond while the spinous process tip remained near the midline.  \\n3. A 12mm centerpiece plate was placed at the spread lamina site, with a 5mm screw fixed to one lateral mass and one lamina. Bleeding was controlled during saline irrigation. Venous bleeding occurred when crossing the lamina but was minimal thereafter. No fractured fragments were noted at the fracture site. Hemovac drains were inserted bilaterally beneath the PVM, followed by fascia, subcutaneous tissue, and skin repair in sequence. The patient was turned to a supine position with a brace applied and transferred to the recovery room.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: [DATE] 9:56 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

A three-point Mayfield fixator was attached to the skull. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was applied. Aseptic draping was performed.  \\n  2. **Approach:** Palpation confirmed C2\\u2013C7 levels. A midline skin incision was made to cover the C2\\u2013C7 level. Neck muscles were dissected midline to expose the C3\\u2013C7 spinous process tips. Paraspinal muscles were subperiosteally dissected to expose the C3\\u2013C7 lamina.  \\n  3. **Main Procedure:**  \\n     - A drill was used to perform bone cutting at the lamina-lateral mass boundary on the right side, starting from C3 to C6 using a burr. Penfield #4 was used to confirm complete cutting.  \\n     - For C7, drilling was performed with a cutting burr, followed by a punch for upper partial laminectomy.  \\n     - On the left side, the same sequence was repeated, creating a groove with a drill to enable hinge function. The lamina was then retracted leftward to decompress the dura, exposing it sufficiently.  \\n     - No dura tear or hinge fracture was observed across all levels. A brand-specific medical plate was used to secure the lamina, with no significant IOM changes.  \\n  4. **Closure:** A H-vac suction device (1 unit, 2-line configuration) was inserted. The wound was closed in anatomic layers with sutures.  \\n  5. **Postoperative:** Patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room.  \\n**Instruments Used:**  \\n- Brand-specific capax plate, GS Medical, 10mm/12mm x 2 units/2 units  \\n- Brand-specific capax screws, GS Medical, 2.0*5mm/2.4*5mm x 4 units/4 units  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 6:32:00 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Two months prior, after lifting heavy objects in the countryside, the patient experienced stiffness in the shoulders and neck. Along with this, numbness and a heavy feeling in both hands occurred. The patient sought care at a local orthopedic clinic, receiving medication and traction therapy. During traction treatment, the patient noted a sensation of tightness in the abdomen and began experiencing a dragging sensation in both legs. The left leg was more pronounced, while the right leg had a less distinct sensation but did not move freely at the patient\\u2019s will. Additionally, both arms, particularly the left arm, had a sensation of heaviness, and the patient could not perform fine movements like picking up a chopstick with the right hand. Sensation was impaired in the hands, but no abnormalities were noted in the torso.  \\n\\nTen days prior, constipation developed, and within a few days, the patient experienced urinary incontinence unrelated to their will. Tilting the head backward caused a tingling sensation from the back of the neck to the thighs. There were no difficulties with speech or facial sensation.

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position with head fixation. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was applied, and aseptic draping was performed.  \\n2. A C-arm was used to confirm the spinal level, and a linear skin incision was made to adequately expose the C6-7 lamina. Paraspinal muscles were split to expose the lamina, followed by a burr and punch to perform a C6-7, 2-level laminectomy, exposing the dura. The dura was not tense.  \\n3. A linear incision was made on the dura, revealing the arachnoid membrane. Upon incising the arachnoid membrane, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) gushed out at a relatively high pressure. The dura and arachnoid membrane were sutured together and reflected laterally to expose the spinal cord.  \\n4. A postspinal vein was noted along the midline of the spinal cord, making myelotomy difficult. To avoid vein damage, a cottonoid was used to cover the cord, exposing only the area free of the vein for myelotomy. A midline myelotomy was performed, allowing visualization of the syrinx\\u2019s internal space. A blunt hook was used to confirm the potential space within the syrinx, verifying cyst fenestration. Primary dura closure was then performed.  \\n5. Bipolar coagulation was used for meticulous hemostasis. A saw was used to partially remove the spinous processes of C6 and C7, followed by a miniplate to perform laminoplasty. The wound was closed layer-by-layer, and the surgery was concluded. Intraoperative monitoring showed no changes.  \\n**Patient was transferred to the recovery room.**  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Time of Documentation:** [DATE] 7:19 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The patient was placed in the supine position under general anesthesia, and neck extension was performed. Bethadine soaping and painting were conducted, followed by aseptic draping.  \\n2. Using C-arm fluoroscopy, the C3-4 level was confirmed, and an oblique skin incision was made along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle.  \\n3. Soft tissue dissection was performed to expose the platysma muscle, followed by a longitudinal incision. The SCM and carotid sheath were identified. Dissection was carried along the medial border of the SCM, with two veins ligated using vascular clips and surgical ties. The carotid sheath was retracted laterally, and the esophagus and trachea were retracted medially.  \\n4. Dissection of the fascia and longus colli muscle exposed the C3-4 vertebral bodies (VB). A Casper screw was inserted along the midline. Due to severe osteoporosis, the screw was inserted without drilling. A Casper retractor was used to distract the C3-4 intervertebral space. Disc material was removed using a #15 blade, pituitary forceps, and punch. Under microscopic visualization, disc material was removed, and the intact posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) was confirmed. To achieve decompression, the PLL was removed to expose the spinal cord. The thecal sac was confirmed to be adequately exposed.  \\n5. Bleeding was controlled meticulously using floseal. A MC Plus Cage with a Genesis Sponge (10\\u00d710\\u00d720 mm) was inserted into the C5-6 intervertebral space. Due to severe osteoporosis, an Atlantis Plate was used to stabilize the Cage at the C3 and C4 VBs.  \\n6. Copious saline irrigation was performed. A JP drain was inserted, and the wound was closed in layers.

The posterior uncinate process was flattened using a high-speed drill. The posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) was exposed, but due to its firmness, thickness, and calcification, only the anterior portion was removed via drilling. The remaining PLL was removed using a hook and punch to expose the dura mater. The dura mater, which had been displaced posteriorly, decompressed and shifted anteriorly upon removal of the PLL.  \\n6. A MC+ cage (14x14xH6, GS Medical) with a genesis sponge (Hanmi) packing was inserted into the C4-5 intervertebral space under C-arm guidance.

The patient was placed in supine position under general anesthesia. The head was elevated using a head rest, and the neck was slightly extended for stabilization. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was applied, followed by a C-arm guide level check. Betadine soaping, painting, and aseptic draping were performed.  \\n2. A paramedian transverse skin incision was made at the right C5-6 level. After a transverse incision of the platysma muscle, dissection was performed along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle to access the area. The trachea and esophagus were retracted medially, and the carotid sheath was retracted laterally to identify the C5-6 vertebral body and intervertebral space. The operative field was covered by omohyoid muscle, which was tied and cut. CCR retractor, Casper screw, and distractor were sequentially applied.  \\n3. The C5-6 intervertebral space was distracted, and bony spurs on the anterior side were drilled and removed. A #15 blade was used to incise the disc material, which was then removed using a pituitary, curette, and punch. The disc material was calcified and yellowish in color.  \\n4. After complete removal of the disc material, the posterior rim of the C5-6 vertebral body was removed to expose the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL). A rupture of the PLL was observed in the central portion, with calcified disc material extruding into the thecal sac and strong adhesion to the thecal sac. The PLL was thoroughly removed using a punch and pituitary, and as much disc material as possible was removed. However, extruded disc material in the superior, inferior, and lateral regions remained due to severe adhesion to the thecal sac, which posed a risk of cord injury. Decompression of the neural structures was confirmed. Hemostasis was achieved using Floseal.  \\n5. A cancellous sponge block (Hanmi Medical, 10\\u00d710\\u00d720 mm) was placed in the C5-6 intervertebral space with a cervical MC+ cage (GS Medical, 14\\u00d714\\u00d76 mm). The anterior bony spur was further drilled, and anterior fixation was performed using a plate (Atlantis Plate, Medtronics, 27.5 mm) and screws (Atlantis Screw, Medtronics, 12 mm \\u00d7 1, 13 mm \\u00d7 2, 14 mm \\u00d7 1).  \\n6. The CCR retractor, Casper screw, and distractor were removed, and hemostasis was achieved using Surgicel. A JP drain was inserted, and the wound was closed in layers. (The omohyoid muscle was reconstructed.)  \\n**Intraoperative Electrophysiological (EP) Changes:** None observed.  \\n**Postoperative Course:** The patient was transferred to the recovery room.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Date/Time:** [DATE] 12:27 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in supine position. Intraoperative Monitoring was applied, and the surgical site was disinfected using betadine, followed by aseptic draping.  \\n2. An incision was made along the medial border of the left sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle from the C3 level to the T1 level. The platysma muscle was incised longitudinally, and the medial side of the SCM was dissected. The omohyoid muscle was also incised longitudinally, and the inferior thyroid artery was ligated and divided. While retracting the carotid sheath laterally, the surgeon entered the surgical field, exposing the bilateral longus colli muscles. A protruding plate and mesh cage were identified.  \\n3. The crew (likely referring to the cage) was removed, but the mesh cage was found to be extensively adherent to surrounding tissues. Attempts to remove the cage using a dill and osteotome were unsuccessful due to its firm fusion with the ventral and lateral vertebral bodies.  \\n4. A C4 copertomy and C3-4 discectomy were performed, followed by a C7-T1 discectomy. The intervertebral spaces were filled with allograft bone, and the site was stabilized using a plate.  \\n5.

The wound was closed in layers, and the procedure was concluded.  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: [DATE] 8:01 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The patient was placed in supine position with a headrest and neck elevator to achieve neck extension. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was installed, and antiseptic draping was performed.  \\n2. After confirming the C4-5 level with a C-arm guide, a left paramedian transverse skin incision was made along the skin crease. Subcutaneous dissection exposed the platysma muscle, which was dissected transversely to expose the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. Dissection between the SCM medial border and infrahyoid muscle revealed the carotid sheath, esophagus, and trachea, which were retracted laterally and medially to visualize the C4-5 vertebral bodies (VB) and intervertebral disc. The longus coli muscles were coagulated to create space for retractors, and CASPER screws were inserted into the C4 and C5 VBs, confirmed with a C-arm.  \\n3. A CCR retractor was placed on the longus coli muscles, and the intervertebral space was widened using a distractor. After incising the C4-5 disc, discectomy was performed with a punch and curette, and endplate preparation was completed. Both Luschka\\u2019s joints were confirmed. Disc material was thoroughly removed using a pituitary and punch, and the endplate was exposed with a curette. Hypertrophic ligamentum flavum (PLL) was removed from the outer layer using a punch, while the inner layer was left intact except for a small portion near the median. The dural sac was partially exposed medially.  \\n4. A cage filled with Osteogrow (bone graft material) was inserted into the C4-5 disc space. The CASPER screws and CCR retractor were removed.  \\n**Osteogrow (bone graft material), Hans (implant), 5cc, 1ea; MC + Cage, MC Plus, 14x14x7mm, 1ea**  \\n5. After hemostasis, a JP drain was inserted into the neck wound, and the wound was closed in layers.  \\n**Posterior Approach - C4-5-6 Laminectomy (+C7 Undercutting) and Posterior Fixation via Lateral Mass Screws:**  \\n6. The patient was repositioned to prone, and neck flexion was performed for skeletal fixation. Post-fixation measurements showed symmetric thenar motor evoked potential (MEP) reduction of 10\\u201320%. A C-arm confirmed the cage was shifted anteriorly by several millimeters compared to the supine position imaging.  \\n7. After completing the posterior approach, the anterior exploration and cage repositioning were planned. The C2 and C7 vertebrae were palpated, and the C4-6 level was reconfirmed with a C-arm. A midline skin incision was made to cover C3-C7, and the trapezius, splenius capitis, and semispinalis muscles were split to expose the spinous tips.  \\n8. The lamina muscles were dissected subperiosteally, and the multifidus muscles were dissected to expose the C4-6 laminae and the upper lamina of C7.  \\n9. Lateral mass screws were inserted bilaterally at C4-5-6.  \\n**Poseidon Cervical Posterior Screw, Innotec, 3.5x14mm, 6ea**  \\n10. Under microscopic view, laminectomy was performed at C4-5-6, and the ligamentum flavum was completely removed to confirm decompression of the thecal sac. The C7 vertebra was undercut using a 4mm cutting burr and punch.  \\n11. The rod was bent appropriately and fixed with capping. Finalization was performed, with a crosslink placed between C4 and C5 for fixation. After HVAC insertion, the wound was closed in layers.  \\n**Crosslink, Innotec, CLP25A, 25mm**  \\n**Anterior Approach - Cage Repositioning and Plating:**  \\n12. To prevent additional anterior malposition of the cage, anterior plating was planned. The patient was repositioned supine, and the previous ACDF incision was reopened, with all muscle sutures removed to expose the disc space and cage.  \\n13. The cage was found to be grossly anteriorly malpositioned, protruding 2mm ventral to the VB anterior margin. Using an impactor, it was carefully repositioned 1mm dorsal to the VB anterior margin. An ATLANTIS plate was used for C4-5 anterior plating.  \\n**ATLANTIS Plate, 25mm, 1ea; ATLANTIS Screw, 14mm variable, 4ea**  \\n14. The previous JP drain was removed, and a new JP drain was inserted. The wound was closed in layers.  \\nBy the time the posterior approach was completed, bilateral thenar MEPs had recovered to the preoperative level, with no significant changes noted on IOM. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 14:53\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The patient was positioned supine with the headrest elevated and neck extended using a neck elevator. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was installed, and antiseptic preparation and aseptic draping were performed.  \\n2. Using a C-arm guide, the C5-6 level was confirmed. A skin incision was made along the left side skin crease. Subcutaneous dissection was performed to expose the platysma muscle, which was then dissected transversely to expose the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. The omohyoid muscle was dissected to retract medially, and the SCM muscle's medial border and infrahyoid muscle space were dissected to expose the carotid sheath, esophagus, and trachea. These structures were retracted laterally and medially to identify the C5-6 vertebral bodies (VB) and intervertebral disc. The longus capitis and longus coli muscles were coagulated to create space for retractors, and Caspar screws were inserted into the C5 and C6 VBs. The level was verified using a C-arm. A Casspar cervical retractor was placed on the longus coli muscles, and the retractor space was expanded using a distractor.  \\n3. After an incision was made into the C5-6 disc, a disectomy was performed using a punch and curette, followed by endplate preparation. Both Luschka's joints were confirmed. The disc material was thoroughly removed using a punch and pituitary, and the endplate was exposed using a curette.  \\n4. A disc compressing the spinal cord on the right side was removed based on MRI findings. The posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) remained intact. The outer layer of the PLL was removed using a punch, while the inner layer was left intact to avoid exposing the dural sac.  \\n5. A cage (MC+C-cage, 14 X 14 X H6, SpineArt) filled with Surechip (5cc, Hans BioMedical) was inserted into the C5-6 disc space. The position was confirmed using a C-arm. The Caspar screw distractor and Casspar cervical retractor were removed.  \\n6. Hemostasis was achieved, and a JP 1ea drain was inserted. Layer-by-layer closure was performed.  \\n7. No significant changes were noted during IOM. The patient was extubated and transferred to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Time of Completion:** [DATE] [TIME]\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in supine position with neck extension. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was installed, and antiseptics and aseptic draping were performed. Baseline findings included weak MEP in the left deltoid and reduced SEP (70-80%) in both lower extremities.  \\n2. Using a C-arm guide, the C6-7 level was confirmed. A diagonal skin incision was made along the medial margin of the right sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. Subcutaneous dissection exposed the platysma muscle and SCM. The SCM and omohyoid muscle were retracted laterally to create space, and the carotid sheath on the lateral side was identified. Progressing medially, the prevertebral space was opened. C6 and C7 vertebral bodies (VB) and intervertebral discs were visualized, and confirmation was repeated using the C-arm.

Caspar screws were inserted into the C6 and C7 VBs, and a distractor was used to widen the intervertebral space. During disc removal, a ruptured disc fragment posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) was identified and removed, revealing a defect in the PLL. Remaining disc material was thoroughly excised using pituitary forceps and punches, and cord decompression was confirmed.  \\n4. Both endplates were exposed via curettage. A tri-cortical bone block (0.9*2.5 cm) was placed in the C6/7 discectomy space. Using the C-arm, the disc space was confirmed to be distracted compared to preoperative imaging. Anterior cervical plating and screw instrumentation were performed, and the position was verified with the C-arm.  \\n   - Skyline Anterior Cervical System, Plate, 20mm, DePuy Synthes, 1 piece  \\n   - Skyline Anterior Cervical System, Screw, 14mm, DePuy Synthes, 4 pieces  \\n5.

Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) was applied. Aseptic draping was performed as usual.  \\nRight-side approach was initiated. Using a C-arm, the C4-6 level was confirmed, and an oblique skin incision was made over the vertebral body (VB) at the C4-6 level. The skin incision was followed by dissection of the platysma muscle and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle, with the carotid sheath identified. The SCM muscle was retracted laterally along with the sheath, while the esophagus and trachea were retracted medially. A retractor was placed to visualize the C4-6 VB and intervertebral disc. The medial borders of the longus coli muscles were coagulated with a bovie device. Casper screws were inserted into the VBs at C4, C5, and C6 levels, confirmed with a C-arm.  \\nC4-5 discectomy was performed. After annulotomy, discectomy was carried out using a punch and pituitary forceps, with end plate preparation using a curette. Both uncinate processes were identified, and the disc was removed laterally to the margin. A defect was noted on the ventral side of the PLL, suggesting disc rupture. The PLL was peeled to identify the inner layer, which was intact. The entire PLL was transversely removed to expose the dural sac, with disc material between the PLLs removed. A dural indentation was observed on the left side. The C5 upper margin was drilled, and a sharp hook was used to remove the inferiorly migrated disc fragment.  \\nThe same approach was applied for C5-6. In this case, diffuse disc protrusion was the main issue, and the PLL was intact, so removal was not performed.  \\nAfter disc space distraction, a cage filled with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and allograft bone chip was inserted. Alignment was confirmed using a C-arm, and the construct was fixed with a plate.  \\nSaline irrigation was performed, and no active bleeding was noted. A JP drain was inserted, and the wound was closed layer by layer, with the skin closed using steri-strips.  \\nPost-extubation, the patient was transferred to the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position with neck flexion, Mayfield head fixation, reverse Trendelenburg position, and antiseptic aseptic draping was performed.  \\n2. After palpation of C2 and C7, a midline skin incision was made at the midpoints of the spinous processes for C2-3-4-5. The nuchal ligament was followed to identify the spinous process (bifida), and subperiosteal dissection was performed bilaterally to expose both laminae and lateral masses. (Severe facet joint arthropathy was observed in the bilateral lateral masses of C3-4-5, with bony spurs covering the facet joints.)  \\n3. A 3mm drill was used to remove the outer cortex and cancellous bone at the boundary between the left lamina and lateral mass of C3-4-5, leaving only the inner table to form a hinge.  \\n4. A gutter was created on the right side using the same method as the left, and the remaining inner table bone was removed with a punch to expose the dura, creating an opening site. The lamina was then gently elevated to maintain an elevated position, with observation of spinal cord swelling in the dorsal space.  \\n5. A center piece plate and screw (GS Medical product) were used to achieve fixation, performing a right open-door laminoplasty.  \\n6. Massive irrigation was performed using antibiotics mixed saline, and a hemovac (m) drain was inserted. Layer-by-layer wound closure was performed, and the surgery was concluded.  \\nPostoperative: The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. No significant intraoperative monitoring changes were observed. (The patient had an intraoperative monitoring amplitude of approximately 80 on the left upper extremity at the start of surgery, which remained similar postoperatively. Other regions maintained values above 120 pre- and post-surgery.)  \\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nCompletion Time: 2022-09-19 6:34 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position with neck flexion, Mayfield head fixation, antiseptic preparation, and aseptic draping performed. IOM setup completed.  \\n2. Using a C-arm, the level was confirmed, and a midline skin incision was made to expose the C5-6-7 spinous processes. The incision followed the avascular plane of the nuchal ligament. Bleeding was noted during muscle dissection.  \\n3. Lateral masses were exposed bilaterally. For C5 and C6, the right laminae were drilled, leaving cortical bone and creating a gutter. The left laminae were drilled near the V point, thinning them to an eggshell-like structure, and then opened using a punch. A highly developed venous plexus was observed immediately below the laminae in the epidural space. Massive epidural bleeding persisted, requiring continuous control with Floseal and bipolar coagulation.  \\n4. Partial resection of the C5 and C6 spinous processes was performed. Retraction of the C5 and C6 to the left was challenging due to persistent epidural bleeding. A left C6-7 foraminotomy was initiated first. Drilling laterally at the C6 V point confirmed the medial border of the facet. Further exposure of the C6 laminae was performed to open the roof of the neural foramen, confirming the exit of the C7 root. Epidural bleeding continued, complicating the procedure. Some perineural tissue around the root was removed.  \\n5. The C5 and C6 laminae were retracted leftward, and open door laminoplasty was performed using the CAPAX OD Plate & Screw system for fixation. No IOM changes occurred during the procedure. A hemovac suction device was placed, and the wound was closed layer by layer. The patient was awakened and transferred to the recovery room.  \\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Time:** [DATE] 8:49 AM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Subperiosteal dissection performed on right side only. L4-5 pedicle-to-pedicle confirmed with C-arm. Partial hemilaminectomy performed on right side using burr, including inferior lamina and interlaminar space. Base of spinous process further modified with diamond burr for better visualization. Thickened ligamentum flavum identified and removed with punch and pituitary forceps to achieve central decompression. Dura lateral margin examined to confirm left L5 root exit. Lateral recess and L5 pedicle area decompressed by removing surrounding bony structures. Disc space confirmed after dura retraction, no disc extrusion or protrusion observed.  \\n   2. Contralateral ligamentum flavum removed. Less central stenosis on contralateral side, so partial ligamentum flavum retained. Base of spinous process further modified with punch.  \\n   3.

Six swab cultures for pus and two tissue cultures for prevertebral soft tissue were sent.  \\nMesh: Synmesh (12-88mm)  \\nCervical Plate: 3-Level 54mm  \\nSurgical Technique and Procedure:  \\n1. General anesthesia was administered with the patient in a supine position and head in neutral alignment. An aseptic draping was performed on the right side for the anterior approach (intraoperative monitoring was not performed due to the surgery occurring after a standard procedure time).  \\n2. An oblique incision was made on the right side to cover the C3-7 level. The skin and subcutaneous layer were incised, followed by dissection to identify the platysma. The omohyoid muscle was dissected, and the carotid sheath was located on the lateral side. Fibrotic tissue adherent to the right side longus colli muscle was identified (likely from a prior tracheostomy surgery). Tissue cultures were sent for the fibrotic tissue, which was then removed. The longus colli muscles were observed to be infected, with partial remnants of C4 and C6 VBs and complete absence of C5 VBs confirmed via C-arm imaging. Pus-like lesions were replaced with fibrotic tissue, and swab cultures were sent for pus. Fibrotic tissue was maximally removed, and residual pus-like lesions were cleared during irrigation.  \\n3. C4 and C6 corpectomy was performed, with the intervertebral discs at C3-4 and C6-7 retained. The PLL, dura, and epidural phlegma at the C4-5 level were noted, with severe adhesion obscuring layer boundaries. Epidural phlegma was maximally removed at the C5 level to expose the dura (no dura injury was observed intraoperatively).  \\n4. Synmesh (12-88mm) was placed at the C4-5-6 anterior portion and confirmed with C-arm imaging. To address instability, the anterior portions of C3 and C7 VBs were fixed with a 3-level 54mm plate and screws, confirmed via C-arm imaging.  \\n5. Irrigation and hemostasis were performed, followed by H-vac insertion and layer-by-layer suturing from the muscle fascia layer. The patient was extubated and transferred to the SICU.  \\nWriter: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nWriting Time: [DATE] 1:16 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with neck extension. Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) was set up, and the C5-6 vertebral body (VB) level was confirmed using a C-arm. A right-sided approach incision line was marked for the procedure. Antiseptic and aseptic draping were performed as usual.  \\n2. A transverse incision was made along the marked line to open the skin and subcutaneous layer, revealing the platysma muscle. This was carefully dissected, followed by dissection along the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) medial border to identify the C5-6 VB and bilateral longus colli muscles. The thick muscle and deep surgical field posed significant challenges. Bipolar cautery was used for meticulous bleeding control, and paravertebral tissues were organized.  \\n3. Retractors were placed on the left/right and anterior/posterior sides to ensure a clear surgical field. A 15-blade annulotome was used to perform the discectomy. Disc material was removed in a piecemeal fashion using a pituitary forcep and curette. A long pin was inserted into the C5 and C6 VB midline, and a retractor was used to widen the intervertebral disc space. Additional disc material was removed to create space for the cage. The posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) was identified and carefully detached using a blunt hook for removal.  \\n4. After meticulous bleeding control, a bone chip-filled Innotec Cage (12\\u00d714\\u00d7H6) was inserted into the C5-6 intervertebral space under C-arm guidance. The expanded disc height was confirmed.  \\n5. Massive saline irrigation was performed to ensure no active bleeding, followed by the insertion of a JP drain. The wound was closed in layers.  \\n- Intraoperative Monitoring (IOM) showed no significant findings.  \\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room.  \\n\\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]/[NAME]  \\nDocumentation Date: [DATE] 11:47\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

The midline skin incision was made at the level of C4-5, centered between C4 and C5, with dissection following the nuchal ligament. A calcification was observed in the posterior region of C4-5, and the spinous process, bilateral lamina, and facet joints were exposed.  \\n3. Due to degenerative changes in the facet joints, which complicated the placement of a stable plate, and the narrow interlaminar space, laminoplasty was deemed unsuitable. The procedure was considered unstable, so a laminectomy at C4-5 was performed. Using a rongeur, the spinous process of C4-5 was removed. The bilateral laminae were then removed with a high-speed drill, and residual bone was carefully excised with a Kerrison rongeur. The central canal space was confirmed to be adequate above at C3/4 and below at C5/6.  \\n4. Bleeding was controlled meticulously using bipolar coagulation and Floseal. A Hemovac drain was placed on the right side. The wound was closed layer by layer.

Patient placed in supine position with neutral head alignment and slight neck extension. C-arm fluoroscope confirmed the C5-6 intervertebral space level. Intraoperative monitoring (IOM) settings were established, followed by aseptic draping.  \\n2. A linear incision was made obliquely to include the left-sided C5-6 level. Platysma muscle was incised, and the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle was retracted laterally. The omohyoid muscle was identified, and dissection proceeded along the avascular plane medial to the carotid sheath. The C5-6 vertebral body was exposed, with the longus colli muscles detached from the vertebral body.  \\n3. Casper screws were inserted bilaterally into the C5-6 vertebral body. A retractor was placed on the screws to widen the intervertebral space. The endplate was drilled, followed by annulotomy and removal of disc material. The left-sided calcified disc with severe adhesion to the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) was carefully dissected and removed, ensuring decompression of the thecal sac and dura.  \\n4. A C-arm guided placement of the Inovis C7 cage (cervical interbody fusion device) 12*14*H6 was performed. The casper screws were removed, and the site was sealed with Surgicel. A plate and screws were applied to stabilize the C5-6 vertebral body, completing the ACDF procedure (C5-6 laminoplasty necessitated plate application).  \\n5. Hemostasis was achieved, and a JP drain was inserted. The wound was closed layer by layer starting from the platysma muscle. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room.  \\n\\nAuthor: [NAME]/[NAME]  \\nWriting Time: [DATE] 5:18 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",

Under general anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with the head in neutral alignment and slight neck extension. The C5-6 intervertebral space level was confirmed using a C-arm. Aseptic draping was performed after IOM settings were established.  \\n2. A transverse incision was made to include the C5-6 level on the right side. The platysma muscle was incised, and the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle was retracted laterally. The anterior aspect of the C5-6 vertebral body was exposed, and the longus colli muscle adherent to the vertebral body was detached. The C5-6 vertebral body and intervertebral space were then identified.  \\n3. A single Casper screw was inserted into the midline of the C5-6 vertebral body. A retractor was placed on the Casper screws to maximize the C5-6 intervertebral space. The C5-6 endplate was drilled, followed by annulotomy of the anterior disc space. The disc material was removed, and the uncinate processes were identified.  \\n4. Under C-arm guidance, an Innotec C7 intervertebral cage was inserted into the C5-6 intervertebral space. The Casper screws were removed, and the removal site was sealed with Surgicel.  \\n5. Hemostasis was achieved on the operating table, and a JP drain (1 unit) was inserted. The wound was closed in layers starting from the platysma muscle. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room without significant intraoperative complications.  \\n\\n**Author:** [NAME]/[NAME]/[NAME]  \\n**Completion Date:** [DATE] at 08:27 PM\"\n}\n</TEXT_REPORTS>\n",
